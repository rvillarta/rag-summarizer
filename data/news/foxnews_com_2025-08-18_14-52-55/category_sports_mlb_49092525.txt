MLBâ€™s regular season typically runs from spring to early fall, with teams playing 162 games. The postseason includes the Wild Card Series, Division Series, League Championship Series and the World Series, where the AL and NL champions compete for the championship.
The league has a long history, dating back to the late 19th century, and has seen changes in rules, team expansions and player milestones over the years. It has remained a central part of professional sports, with a strong fan base and significant media coverage.
Beyond the game, MLB is involved in business partnerships, broadcasting agreements and community initiatives. It continues to be a major presence in sports, with an ongoing impact on baseball at both the professional and youth levels.
