The opening chapter traces Tianjin's evolution, moving from ancient landmarks, such as Dule Temple, Ancient Culture Street, Mazu Temple, and the Astor Hotel, to modern cityscapes, including Italian Style Street, the Haihe River, and Jinwan Plaza. The second chapter underlines Tianjin's position as an open, innovative hub. It showcases major infrastructure, including Tianjin Port, Binhai International Airport, the China (Tianjin) Pilot Free Trade Zone, and the National Supercomputing Center, as well as advanced manufacturing at the Airbus final assembly line, COOEC's intelligent production base, and the Long March rocket plant. Portal of Myriad Wondershighlights the city's cultural and ecological life, from traditional crafts, like Clay Figure Zhang sculptures and Yangliuqing woodblock prints, to museums and historic sites, including the Drum Tower and Guangdong Guild Hall. The final chapter, Gateway of Harmony, reflects Tianjin's growing international role. It features the World Intelligence Expo, the Luban Workshop, and the China–Europe Railway Express, underscoring the city's drive to foster global dialogue and cooperation.
