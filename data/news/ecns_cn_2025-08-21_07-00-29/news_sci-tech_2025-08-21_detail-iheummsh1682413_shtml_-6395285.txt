The service, which is run by IM Motors, SAIC Motor's mobility service platform Xiangdao Chuxing and SAIC AI Lab, also offers short-distance connections between popular spots within the Shanghai International Resort area, reported the Shanghai Observer, citing IM Motors. Passengers can book rides from designated pick-up points through Xiangdao Chuxing's mobile app, with the trip from the resort to Pudong International Airport taking about 30 minutes. As part of the route includes highways, a safety operator will be in the driver's seat. In emergencies, the Robotaxi can be switched to manual mode to allow the operator to take control. As the service is still in its pilot phase, rides on the route are offered free of charge. On Friday, L4 Robotaxis began paid public operations in Shanghai's Lin-gang Special Area, with 58 designated stops covering tourist attractions, commercial centers, residential communities and transport hubs.
