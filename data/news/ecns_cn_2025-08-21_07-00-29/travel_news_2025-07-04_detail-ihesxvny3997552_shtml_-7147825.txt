The surge comes as expanded visa-free policies and new international flights have transformed the island into one of China's top destinations for foreign travelers. Foreign arrivals and departures rose 48 percent year-on-year to 663,000, with visa-free entries jumping 76 percent to 269,000. Visa-free travelers now account for nearly 90 percent of all foreign arrivals, surpassing pre-pandemic 2019 levels by 6.6 percent. The growth follows the expansion of Hainan Free Trade Port's visa-waiver policies, which now cover citizens from 85 countries — the most favorable visa-free arrangement in China. "Hainan's combination of visa-free access and increasing international air connectivity is creating perfect conditions for tourism growth," said Luo Zhengyu, deputy director of the Haikou General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection. The policies include a 240-hour transit waiver, 15-day exemptions for foreign cruise groups and 144-hour stays for tour groups arriving from Hong Kong and Macao. The province's international aviation network has expanded rapidly, with new direct services to London, Tokyo and Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, bringing the total number of international flights to 72. Hainan's three international airports handled 2,800 visa-free transit passengers in the first half of this year, a 203 percent increase from last year. Visitors from the United States, the United Kingdom and Colombia were among the fastest-growing groups. To handle increased traffic, border authorities have introduced measures to speed up processing. "We've optimized our procedures to ensure smooth processing even during peak periods," said He Jiyi, head of the border inspection department. During the May Day holiday, Hainan processed 38,000 inbound travelers, up 52 percent year-on-year. The tourism boom is delivering economic benefits across the island. "The entry process was incredibly fast," said Russian visitor Peter Dernert, who was vacationing in Sanya with his family. "We heard about Hainan from friends and wanted to experience its beaches and shopping." Industry professionals highlighted Hainan's unique appeal. "The island offers world-class golf resorts at competitive prices that attract Japanese and South Korean visitors, while its tropical climate is perfect for European tourists," said Mai Weiwen, CEO of Hainan Wenhua Tourism Group. He noted recent improvements that reduced entry processing from about one hour to just minutes through preregistration systems. At the news conference, immigration authorities announced six new measures aimed at further improving the travel experience for residents and international visitors. The measures include online processing for group tour visas with reduced documentation, fee waivers for first-time Taiwan travel permit applications and streamlined clearance for ships at anchor through digital permits. Transit passengers will benefit from combined processing of temporary entry permits and immigration checks, while dedicated lanes will be established for student groups during the summer travel season. Major events will receive priority clearance services through a new express channel system. Technological upgrades are playing a key role. "We've moved from paper-based processes to an automated digital system, and slashed border processing times by 60 percent for businesses through comprehensive digital reforms," said Yan Yong, head of the information technology department at the border inspection station. As Hainan prepares for its island-wide independent customs operations, the tourism surge is providing a glimpse of its growing international reach. With visitor numbers already exceeding pre-pandemic records and new policies taking effect, the island appears poised for continued growth as China's southern gateway.
