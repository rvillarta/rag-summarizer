The decision aims to provide a more convenient link between Shanghai Pudong and cities across the Yangtze River Delta, while further boosting the airport's transit efficiency and capacity, according to the Shanghai-based operator. With the new transit route, China Eastern will operate a total of 76 flights between Shanghai Pudong and six other Chinese cities - the others being Nanjing in Jiangsu province, Nanchang in Jiangxi province, Hefei in Anhui province, and Lishui, Ningbo and Wenzhou in Zhejiang province. Passengers can connect seamlessly to international destinations at Shanghai Pudong via the transit flight without additional procedures, according to China Eastern. China Eastern has also introduced a special family package under which two adults purchasing business-class tickets for designated dates can bring a child in the same cabin for free, paying only the taxes and fees, said the carrier.
