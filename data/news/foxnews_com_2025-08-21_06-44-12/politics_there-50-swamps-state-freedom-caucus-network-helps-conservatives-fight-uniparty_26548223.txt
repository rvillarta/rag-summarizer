Listen to this article 2 min Andrew Roth, president of the State Freedom Caucus Network, helms an organization fighting to help conservatives win and wield control of state governments across the nation. "There is a swamp in all 50 states. There are 50 swamps," Roth told Fox News Digital during a Tuesday interview, noting that "liberal Republicans" join with Democrats to expand government. This "uniparty" phenomenon exists in the U.S. Congress and in every state, Roth indicated, asserting that in red states many Democrats cannot win elections unless they don the Republican label.

And then once you can do that, then you can hopefully start getting good people elected and then cut the budget, cut taxes, cut spending," he explained.
