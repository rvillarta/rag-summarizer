LIU HONGJIE/CHINA DAILY The 3rd China-Russia Library Forum opened at the Pashkov Palace of the Russian State Library in Moscow on Aug 14, bringing together experts, diplomats, and cultural leaders looking to advance bilateral cooperation in library science and shared cultural heritage preservation. The event, a highlight of the ongoing China-Russia Culture Year, underscores the deepening cultural synergy between the two nations. In an address delivered by Deputy Minister of Culture Zhanna Alexeyeva on behalf of Russia's Minister of Culture Olga Lyubimova, Lyubimova highlighted the fact that libraries are "indispensable platforms" for strengthening people-to-people ties. "China-Russia cultural cooperation, built on shared values and mutual understanding, lays a solid foundation for our bilateral relations," she said. "Library exchanges serve as vital bridges connecting our peoples and deepening cross-cultural dialogue." China's Ambassador to Russia Zhang Hanhui underscored literature's role in fostering youth engagement, noting: "Chinese books, particularly online literature and contemporary works, have gained remarkable popularity in Russia. They have become a new bond linking the younger generations, allowing Russians to feel the vitality of modern China's development." The forum yielded two major agreements. The Manuscript Reproduction Pact, which was signed between the Russian State Library and the National Library of China, enables the exchange and digital replication of rare historical manuscripts. And the Far Eastern State Scientific Library (Russia) and Capital Library of China (Beijing) forged a partnership to expand resource sharing and joint research. The accords aim to enhance access to unique collections and leverage digital technologies for heritage conservation, which are key themes of this year's forum, which is titled Cultural Heritage Protection and Restoration: Best Practices from Both Nations. The forum aligns with the 2024-2025 China-Russia Culture Year, which was initiated during President Vladimir Putin's state visit to China in May 2024 and reflects the broader commitments outlined in the China-Russia joint statement commemorating 75 years of diplomatic relations, which prioritizes "cultural cooperation to consolidate the social foundation of bilateral ties". Since its inaugural session in 2023, the forum has evolved into a dynamic engine for the exchange of knowledge. This year's focus on digitization and youth engagement signals a forward-looking approach to preserving shared histories while nurturing new cultural narratives, organizers said. As libraries transform into hubs of cross-border innovation, the 3rd China-Russia Library Forum aims to exemplify how cultural institutions can forge resilient international partnerships. Collaborative exhibitions and digitized manuscript collections are expected to debut in 2026, with plans to expand youth literary exchange programs.
