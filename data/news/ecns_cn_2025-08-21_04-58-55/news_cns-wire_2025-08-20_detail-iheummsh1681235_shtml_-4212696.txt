Black Myth: Zhong Kui is the second work in the Black Myth series and will adopt the same business model as Black Myth: Wukong, according to Game Science. Set against the backdrop of the classic Chinese folktale "Zhong Kui Banishing Evil," Black Myth: Zhong Kui is a single-player action role-playing game rooted in ancient Chinese fantasy, Game Science said. The developer noted that the game is currently in the early stage of development, and the release date is yet to be decided. Black Myth: Wukong is China's first true AAA game, featuring high development costs, long production cycles, and significant resource investment. Based on the classical Chinese literary masterpiece "Journey to the West," Black Myth: Wukong became a massive hit domestically and internationally upon its release last August, selling over 10 million copies within just three days. Its success has boosted confidence among Chinese game developers to expand into overseas markets.
