    "article_summary": "Valley Fever cases are surging in California, with the total for 2025 likely to exceed the record-breaking 2024 numbers. The fungal infection, caused by breathing in soil spores, can be severe and is particularly prevalent in Southern California and Arizona. Certain groups, including the elderly, those with weakened immune systems, pregnant women, and people of color, are at higher risk. Symptoms can mimic those of COVID-19 and may require hospitalization and long-term medical care.</s>"
