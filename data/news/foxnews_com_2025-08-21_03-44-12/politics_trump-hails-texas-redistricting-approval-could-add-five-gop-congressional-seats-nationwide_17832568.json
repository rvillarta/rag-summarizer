    "article_summary": "Texas Governor Greg Abbott discusses a redistricting plan that adds up to five new GOP-leaning congressional seats, which President Donald Trump calls a \"Big WIN\" for Republicans. Trump urges other Republican-led states to follow Texas's lead, claiming it will lead to less crime, a strong economy, and a stronger Second Amendment. The plan, however, faces opposition from Democrats who argue it dilutes minority voting power and is racially discriminatory.</s>"
