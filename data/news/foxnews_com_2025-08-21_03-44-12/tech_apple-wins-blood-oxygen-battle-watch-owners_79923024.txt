NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! Listen to this article 5 min Apple Watch owners in the U.S. just got a big reason to update their devices. Apple just rolled out a redesigned Blood Oxygen feature to specific models, following a recent victory in a legal dispute. This change affects Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 users who have been without the feature due to the ongoing battle. Thanks to a U.S. Customs ruling, these users will soon be able to track their blood oxygen levels again, with a twist. The feature wasn't allowed on U.S. models in the first place because of an ongoing patent dispute with Masimo, a medical technology company that claimed Apple's sensor design infringed on its pulse oximetry patents. Apple disabled the feature on new models sold in the U.S. to comply with that ruling, even while it appealed the case. U.S. Customs became involved because the dispute wasn't only about software; it also covered the physical devices being imported. Customs enforces trade bans and patent rulings, so Apple had to get its redesign cleared before shipping watches with the updated feature into the country. CAN YOUR APPLE WATCH DETECT PREGNANCY?
