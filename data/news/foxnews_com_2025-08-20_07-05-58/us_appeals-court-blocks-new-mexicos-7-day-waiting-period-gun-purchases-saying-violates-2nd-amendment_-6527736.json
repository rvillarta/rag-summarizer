    "article_summary": "Federal Appeals Court Rules New Mexico's 7-Day Waiting Period for Gun Purchases Unconstitutional, Infringing on Second Amendment Rights. The ruling, which leaves the law on hold, was in response to a lawsuit filed by the Mountain States Legal Foundation and National Rifle Association, arguing that the law delayed access to firearms for citizens, including victims of domestic violence. The court found that there was no historical tradition of firearm regulation that supported the modern-day law.</s>"
