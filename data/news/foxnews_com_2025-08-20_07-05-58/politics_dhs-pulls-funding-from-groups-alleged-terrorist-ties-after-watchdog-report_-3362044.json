The review primarily targets funding distributed through FEMA\u2019s Nonprofit Security Grant Program and includes a focus on organizations like the Islamic Circle of North America and the Council on American Islamic Relations, which have been accused of having extremist ties. DHS is also examining ways to recover unspent funds and has tightened requirements for fiscal year 2025 applicants to ensure a robust vetting process.</s>"
