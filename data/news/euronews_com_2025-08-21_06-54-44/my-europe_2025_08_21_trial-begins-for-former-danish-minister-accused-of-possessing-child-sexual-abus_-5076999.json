    "article_summary": "Former Danish Minister Henrik Sass Larsen stands trial for possessing child sexual abuse material and a child-like doll designed for sexual purposes. He pleads not guilty, claiming the images are of himself as a child and the doll was an accidental gift. His defense argues that simple possession is not enough for guilt, and the materials must be shown to have been intended for criminal use. If found guilty, he could face up to one year in prison for each charge.</s>"
