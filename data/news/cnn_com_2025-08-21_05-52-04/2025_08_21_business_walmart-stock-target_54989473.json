    "article_summary": "Walmart's sales at US stores increased by 4.8% in Q1 2025, with growth across income groups, particularly upper-income households. The retail giant, despite tariff-induced cost increases, maintains low prices to attract customers. Target, on the other hand, is struggling with slumping sales and its CEO stepping down, due to a focus on non-essential goods and higher tariff-related price increases.</s>"
