    "article_summary": "California and Texas are moving forward with redistricting efforts, with California Democrats proposing a constitutional amendment to temporarily redraw congressional maps and potentially gain five seats, while Republicans in Texas aim to create five more GOP-leaning House districts. The California legislature will consider a trio of bills to allow for a special election to pass the amendment, but it needs a two-thirds majority vote in both chambers to pass. Meanwhile, the Texas House has approved new congressional maps, and the Republican-dominated state Senate is expected to pass the redistricting plan.</s>"
