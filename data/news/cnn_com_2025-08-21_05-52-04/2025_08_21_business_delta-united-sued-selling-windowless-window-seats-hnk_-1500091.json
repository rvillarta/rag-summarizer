    "article_summary": "Delta and United Airlines are being sued by passengers for selling \"window\" seats that lack windows, misleading customers who paid extra for these seats. The lawsuits, filed in San Francisco and Brooklyn, seek millions in damages for over a million passengers at each airline. The complaints allege that some planes contain seats with missing windows due to air conditioning ducts, electrical conduits, or other components. The airlines do not flag these seats during the booking process, unlike competitors like Alaska Airlines and American Airlines.</s>"
