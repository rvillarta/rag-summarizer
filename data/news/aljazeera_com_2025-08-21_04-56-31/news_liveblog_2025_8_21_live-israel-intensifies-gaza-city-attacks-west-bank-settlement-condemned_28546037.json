    "article_summary": "Israel's Gaza City offensive risks further international isolation and reputational damage, according to Haaretz columnist Gideon Levy. The offensive, which the Red Cross deems \"intolerable,\" is seen as the beginning of ethnic cleansing by Levy, as Israel has not discussed a recent ceasefire proposal from Hamas. Meanwhile, Israeli families of captives are calling for an antiwar march in Tel Aviv. In response, Israel is planning a diplomatic outreach initiative to bring hundreds of international delegations to Israel to spread its narrative.</s>"
