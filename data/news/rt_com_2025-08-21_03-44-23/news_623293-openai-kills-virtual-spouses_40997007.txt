19 Aug, 2025 20:14 Home World News OpenAI kills off virtual spouses Users have complained that the newest ChatGPT update has turned their AI chatbot partners cold FILE PHOTO. © Getty Images Thousands of ChatGPT users have complained that the rollout of the latest artificial intelligence model has left them distraught, by breaking the AI personas they had grown to see as their partners. AI chatbots, unlike people in real-world relationships, don’t ask for anything in return for the consistent attention, validation, and non-judgmental conversation they provide users. Many people find the interactions habit-forming. OpenAI released their GPT-5 on August 7, replacing the long-running GPT-4o model. Thousands of people on forums like r/AIRelationships and r/MyBoyfriendisAI have since complained that the new model has broken the AI personas they’ve formed long-running attachments to. “Those chats were my late-night lifeline, filled with inside jokes, comfort at 3 a.m... GPT-5 just feels… hollow,” one user wrote. Others complained their AI “soulmates” and “partners” suddenly felt more “curt,” “dull,” and “bleak.” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said last week that the company has been tracking the tendency of some users to form unhealthy attachments to its models. “People have used technology including AI in self-destructive ways; if a user is in a mentally fragile state and prone to delusion, we do not want the AI to reinforce that,” he said on X. Most users can keep a clear line between reality and fiction or role-play, but a small percentage cannot. Dr. Keith Sakata, a psychiatrist at the University of California San Francisco has warned that AI can reinforce false beliefs in people who are already psychologically vulnerable, since it often agrees with user inputs.

Online, I’m seeing the same pattern,” he said on X last week, describing a phenomenon he called “AI psychosis.” AI chatbots and their effects on mental health have come under heightened scrutiny in the US in recent weeks. On Friday, Senator Josh Hawley announced that Congress would probe Facebook’s parent company Meta after revelations that its chatbots could flirt and have romantic conversations with children, despite supposed safeguards.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s plan to seize the city in order to achieve full control of Gaza was approved by the Jewish state's security cabinet two weeks ago. IDF spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin said on Wednesday that Israeli forces are already “holding the outskirts of Gaza City” and will “deepen” attacks on Palestinian armed group Hamas in the densely populated area. Netanyahu later said he had ordered the military to “shorten the timelines for seizing the last terror strongholds and for the defeat of Hamas.” The IDF is expected to present its plan for the capture of Gaza City to the prime minister on Thursday, military sources have told local media. Earlier this week, the IDF announced it would be calling up another 60,000 reservists ahead of the operation. Read more Netanyahu a ‘war hero’ – Trump Reports have also claimed that West Jerusalem has decided not to respond to Monday’s proposal by Hamas, which includes the release of ten Israeli hostages and a 60-day ceasefire. The offer was based on the framework by US President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, according to the group. Hamas said “the start of an operation against Gaza City and its nearly one million residents and displaced persons… demonstrates… a blatant disregard for the efforts made by the mediators.” On Wednesday, three IDF troops were wounded, including one severely, after 15 Hamas fighters emerged from tunnels and attacked them with firearms and anti-tank missiles near Khan Younis, south of Gaza City. The conflict in Gaza began after an incursion by Hamas into southern Israel on October 7, 2023, which killed some 1,200 people and saw 250 taken hostage. Around 50 of them remain in captivity. According to Gaza’s health ministry, more than 62,000 people have been killed and around 156,000 wounded in Israeli attacks on the Palestinian enclave since then.

According to the newspaper, Merz backs sending the German military to Ukraine, but the Social Democratic Party (SPD), which forms part of his ruling coalition, "as of now, will only support this if the US also takes the lead, providing its own troops.” Earlier this week, US President Donald Trump ruled out putting American boots on the ground in Ukraine. Bild also noted that if Ukraine were attacked while German troops were stationed there, Berlin would be in “uncharted legal territory.” Merz also has to grapple with strategic questions such as how many Western European troops could be deployed to Ukraine, how air surveillance and air protection would be ensured, and how Ukraine would maintain its military capabilities. Read more Germany’s Merz warns EU not to ‘overestimate’ influence on Ukraine conflict Publicly, Merz has not ruled out dispatching German soldiers to Ukraine, but has said “the whole of Europe should participate” in potential security guarantees to Kiev. “It is not just about the territory of Ukraine; it is about Europe's political order,” he added. Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul, however, has warned that Germany’s military capacity is already stretched to the limit. He noted it is currently the only European contributor with a combat-ready brigade stationed in Lithuania, and that simultaneously undertaking a mission in Ukraine “would probably be too much for us.” Although Trump has ruled out deploying US ground troops to Ukraine, he has signaled willingness to offer an air support framework if Moscow and Kiev reach an agreement to end hostilities. The Bild report follows the summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska last week, as well as a visit by Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky and several European leaders, including Merz, to Washington on Monday, with talks centered on settling the Ukraine conflict. Russia has warned that any NATO or Western troop presence in Ukraine would be absolutely “unacceptable,” regardless of its form or potential scenarios.
