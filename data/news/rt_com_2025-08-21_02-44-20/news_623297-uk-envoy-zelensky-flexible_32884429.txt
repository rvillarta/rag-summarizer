He argued that the security guarantees offered by the West could help the Ukrainian leader ease domestic opposition if he is forced to make concessions to Russia. Zelensky acknowledged that potential land swaps were discussed during his meeting with US President Donald Trump in Washington on Monday. Trump, meanwhile, suggested that an immediate ceasefire may not be essential for a lasting peace agreement. Speaking to Newsmax on Tuesday, Mandelson said Zelensky may need political leeway to overcome hardliners in Ukraine. “He may go back to Kiev and find he doesn’t have the political support for the flexibility that he’s got to show in order to help bring this to an end,” Mandelson said, as cited by The Times.

Trump told Fox News that Zelensky must “show some flexibility,” and reiterated his plan to arrange a Putin-Zelensky summit, possibly followed by a trilateral meeting involving himself, Putin, and Zelensky. The specifics of the guarantees that could be offered to Ukraine remain unclear, as the US has ruled out full NATO membership, while Russia has said it will not tolerate Western troops on Ukrainian soil. Moscow has also demanded that the West stop supplying Kiev with weapons. You can share this story on social media: Follow RT on UK Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky Dear readers!

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s plan to seize the city in order to achieve full Israeli control of Gaza was approved by the security cabinet two weeks ago. IDF spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin said on Wednesday that Israeli forces are already “holding the outskirts of Gaza City” and will “deepen” attacks on Palestinian armed group Hamas in the densely populated area. Netanyahu later said he had ordered the military to “shorten the timelines for seizing the last terror strongholds and for the defeat of Hamas.” The IDF is expected to present its plan for the capture of Gaza City to the prime minister on Thursday, military sources have told local media. Earlier this week, the IDF announced it would be calling up another 60,000 reservists ahead of the operation. Read more Netanyahu a ‘war hero’ – Trump Reports have also claimed that West Jerusalem has decided not to respond to Monday’s proposal by Hamas, which includes the release of ten Israeli hostages and a 60-day ceasefire. The offer was based on the framework by US President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, according to the group. Hamas said “the start of an operation against Gaza City and its nearly one million residents and displaced persons… demonstrates… a blatant disregard for the efforts made by the mediators.” On Wednesday, three IDF troops were wounded, including one severely, after 15 Hamas fighters emerged from tunnels and attacked them with firearms and anti-tank missiles near Khan Younis, south of Gaza City. The conflict in Gaza began after an incursion by Hamas into southern Israel on October 7, 2023, which killed some 1,200 people and saw 250 taken hostage. Around 50 of them remain in captivity. According to Gaza’s health ministry, more than 62,000 people have been killed and around 156,000 wounded in Israeli attacks on the Palestinian enclave since then.

According to the newspaper, Merz backs sending the German military to Ukraine, but the SPD, which forms part of a ruling coalition, "as of now, will only support this if the US also takes the lead, providing its own troops.” Earlier this week, US President Donald Trump ruled out putting American boots on the ground in Ukraine. Bild also noted that if Ukraine were attacked while German troops were stationed there, Berlin would be in “uncharted legal territory.” Merz also has to grapple with strategic questions such as how many European troops could be deployed to Ukraine, how air surveillance and air protection would be ensured, and how Ukraine would maintain its military capabilities. Read more Germany’s Merz warns EU not to ‘overestimate’ influence on Ukraine conflict Publicly, Merz has not ruled out dispatching German soldiers to Ukraine, but has said “the whole of Europe should participate” in potential security guarantees to Kiev. “It is not just about the territory of Ukraine; it is about Europe's political order,” he added. Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul, however, has warned that Germany’s military capacity is already stretched to the limit. He noted it is currently the only European contributor with a combat-ready brigade stationed in Lithuania, and that simultaneously undertaking a mission in Ukraine “would probably be too much for us.” Although Trump has ruled out deploying US ground troops to Ukraine, he has signaled willingness to offer an air support framework if Moscow and Kiev reach an agreement to end hostilities. The Bild report follows the summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska last week, as well as a visit by Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky and several European leaders, including Merz, to Washington on Monday, with talks centered on settling the Ukraine conflict. Russia has warned that any NATO or Western troop presence in Ukraine would be absolutely “unacceptable,” regardless of its form or potential scenarios.

The move is part of President Donald Trump’s broader campaign to cut wasteful spending and depoliticize federal agencies. In a statement on Wednesday, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said the core functions of the “redundant” Foreign Malign Influence Center (FMIC) will be transferred to other bodies. Congress established the FMIC in 2019 following claims of Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, which Trump won. While Moscow denied seeking to sway the vote, Trump and the Republicans argued the allegations were part of a Democratic effort to delegitimize his victory and undermine his presidency. Read more Declassified emails expose Obama intel chief’s role in Russiagate hoax “FMIC and its predecessor entities were used by the previous administration to justify the suppression of free speech and to censor political opposition,” Gabbard said. Since mid-July, Gabbard has released multiple documents she claims expose a coordinated effort by senior Obama-era officials to falsely accuse Trump of colluding with Russia. On Tuesday, she added that, contrary to some claims, Moscow “did not appear to have any preference for one candidate over the other.” According to Gabbard, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence became “hyper-focused” on elections in 2017 after the CIA prepared a “manufactured” report falsely claiming that Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted to help Trump win.
