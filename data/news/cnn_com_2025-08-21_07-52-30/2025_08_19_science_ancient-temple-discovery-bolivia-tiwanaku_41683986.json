    "article_summary": "Archaeologists have discovered a new temple complex, Palaspata, in Bolivia's Caracollo municipality, believed to be an ancient Tiwanaku temple. The site, located southeast of Lake Titicaca, sheds light on the interconnectivity of the Tiwanaku society and its expansion strategies, as it lies outside the known borders of the Tiwanaku empire. The temple, used for large gatherings and drinking chicha, may have served as a gateway for Tiwanaku's power in the region.</s>"
