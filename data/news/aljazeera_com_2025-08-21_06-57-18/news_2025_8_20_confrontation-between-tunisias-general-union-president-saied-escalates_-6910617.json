    "article_summary": "Tunisia's General Labour Union (UGTT) is set to protest against President Kais Saied on August 21, accusing the government of undermining workers' rights and using intimidation to curb strikes. The UGTT, a significant force in Tunisia's history, has been a counter to Saied's power since he seized power in 2021, but internal schisms and a weakened position may complicate matters.</s>"
