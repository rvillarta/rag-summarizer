    "article_summary": "Texas Democrats protest GOP-led redistricting plan, with Rep. Nicole Collier refusing to leave the House chamber under law enforcement watch, as the state House prepares to vote on a bill that would add five more Republican-leaning House districts. Democrats have no power to stop the bill's passage but continue to protest GOP tactics, with some tearing up their \"permission slips\" to leave the chamber. The House vote is expected Wednesday, with the Senate vote potentially on Thursday.</s>"
