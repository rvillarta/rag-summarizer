    "article_summary": "\"New research suggests a hot rock mass beneath New Hampshire, known as the Northern Appalachian Anomaly, may be the reason the Appalachian Mountains are still standing tall. The anomaly, formed when Greenland and North America separated 80 million years ago, could help explain why ancient mountains like the Appalachians haven't eroded as much as expected.\"</s>"
