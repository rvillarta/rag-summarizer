    "article_summary": "President Donald Trump claims to have ended six wars during his second term, spanning various regions, including the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. However, the validity of these claims is questionable, with some deals resembling ceasefires rather than permanent peace agreements. Trump's record is also marred by failed peace efforts with North Korea and Israel-Hamas conflict.</s>"
