    "article_summary": "Trump calls for review of Smithsonian museums to align with his political directives, focusing on positive aspects of American history and removing \"divisive or partisan narratives.\" The Smithsonian, which runs major public museums, including the National Museum of African American History and Culture, has been asked to provide a wide array of materials for review and has declined to comment on Trump's latest remarks. Critics argue that the demands set the Smithsonian up for failure due to the extensive planning and evaluation required for exhibits.</s>"
