    "article_summary": "UK regulators have banned a Sanex shower gel ad for implying white skin is superior to black skin, following complaints about the depiction of a Black model with scratch marks and a cracked skin texture, while a White model was shown with smoother, clean skin after using the product. Colgate-Palmolive, the brand's owner, defended the ad as demonstrating diversity, but the Advertising Standards Authority ruled it breached the broadcast advertising code and was likely to cause offense.</s>"
