    "article_summary": "Chinese refineries have increased orders for Russian crude, shifting from usual suppliers India, due to US tariffs on Indian exports. This is a strategic move as Russian oil remains cheaper than Middle Eastern alternatives. However, China is unlikely to fully compensate for the reduced Russian oil imports by India, as China's daily seaborne Russian oil purchases are lower than India's.</s>"
