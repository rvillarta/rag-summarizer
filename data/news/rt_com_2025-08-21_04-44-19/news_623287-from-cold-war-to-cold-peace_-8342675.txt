19 Aug, 2025 20:53 Home World News From cold war to cold peace: What the Anchorage and White House meetings mean for the world Trump’s summit with Putin in Alaska and talks with European leaders in Washington signal a shift from confrontation to cautious coexistence By Alexander Bobrov , PhD in History and head of diplomatic studies at the Institute for Strategic Research and Forecasts at RUDN University, author of the book “The Grand Strategy of Russia.” Follow his Telegram channel “Diplomacy and the World.” By Alexander Bobrov , PhD in History and head of diplomatic studies at the Institute for Strategic Research and Forecasts at RUDN University, author of the book “The Grand Strategy of Russia.” Follow his Telegram channel “Diplomacy and the World.” Diplomacy and the World The Grand Strategy of Russia US President Donald Trump. © Andrew Harnik/Getty Images Alaska doesn’t boast globally iconic landmarks or world-famous museums, yet year-round it draws travelers from around the world. They come to the northernmost corner of the United States with a curious observation in mind: behind the cold surface and icy serenity of its wilderness, America’s only Arctic state offers a striking paradox. Beneath the frost lies a warmth and hospitality that reveals itself to anyone willing to look deeper – into the land and into the lives of the people who call it home. The same paradox applies to the recent US–Russia summit in Anchorage. At first glance, the meeting between the two presidents looked distant, almost sterile, with no headline-grabbing agreements or breakthroughs. But look closer, and the encounter appears warmer and more constructive – less about optics, more about substance. For relations long shaped by the Cold War, the iceberg metaphor holds: what’s visible above the surface is only a fraction of the mass beneath the waterline. A quick scan of the headlines might suggest that the hastily arranged summit, its agenda rewritten on the fly, produced little of value. No signed deals, no grand announcements. But in fact, it marked the first in-person meeting between the leaders of the two nuclear superpowers since 2021. That alone was enough to thaw long-frozen channels of communication – and may well provide the prologue to a series of bilateral and multilateral talks between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump aimed at tackling the toughest items on the global agenda. Read more The old world order cracked in Alaska For the ice to begin cracking, both Moscow and Washington had to overcome a mutual estrangement rooted in years of mistrust and the absence of direct dialogue. The Russian delegation feared the summit was little more than a stage set for Trump to score headlines and angle for a Nobel Peace Prize. Trump, meanwhile, was wary of reigniting the old narrative of his alleged ties to Moscow – a storyline that haunted him after his 2020 election loss, dogged him through lawsuits, and shadowed him even after he survived an assassination attempt during the 2024 campaign. It was with that history in mind that Putin opened the meeting with a pointed greeting: “Good afternoon, dear neighbor. Glad to see you in good health – and alive.” Trump, careful not to be seen as overly chummy with his Russian counterpart, tweaked the protocol. Instead of greeting Putin at the plane, he orchestrated a simultaneous red-carpet walkout on the tarmac at Elmendorf–Richardson Air Force Base. In the summit sessions he declined a one-on-one, replacing it with a “three-on-three” format: Sergey Lavrov and Yury Ushakov on the Russian side, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff on the American. The move shielded Trump from accusations that, left alone with Putin, he would cave. Still, the two men did get a private exchange – inside Trump’s car en route to the talks. The discussions themselves were brisk, barely two hours instead of the planned six or seven. The working lunch was scrapped. Even the press conference broke protocol: Putin spoke first, and at length – two and a half times longer than the summit’s host. Unsurprisingly, the media spun it both ways. Pessimists said the cold front hadn’t lifted and that hopes of a thaw were dead on arrival. Optimists countered that the streamlined format meant every major item on the bilateral agenda was addressed, clearing the way for real follow-up. Reality, as usual, lies somewhere in between. The next day, selective leaks from the American side gave a hint: Washington had come face-to-face with Russia’s deeply rehearsed arguments. The US realized that progress – from arms control to Arctic cooperation – depends on addressing the issue that started the political winter: Ukraine. Only a comprehensive peace deal, one that settles the conflict at its root, could allow true forward movement. Read more Red carpet for a new world order: What really went down in Alaska Which is why the logical sequel to Anchorage was Trump’s Monday meeting in Washington with Vladimir Zelensky and a cluster of European leaders. Gathered in the Oval Office were Emmanuel Macron, Friedrich Merz, Alexander Stubb, Keir Starmer, Giorgia Meloni, NATO’s Mark Rutte, and Ursula von der Leyen. The scene resembled less a sovereign summit than a board meeting of “Corporation West,” chaired by Trump as CEO. Hastily convened, the session left analysts debating its meaning. European media framed it as progress on security guarantees for Ukraine. If that’s true, Trump risks falling into the same rut as Biden: pledging military aid, chasing incremental assurances, and watching his peace agenda collapse under the weight of Kiev’s expectations. That would mean not only the failure of his self-styled role as dealmaker-in-chief, but also a harder Russian line in future negotiations. In that scenario, US–Russia ties might still inch forward – but not nearly in the way either country would prefer. Yet White House sources told a different story. Trump, they stressed, remains focused on a full-fledged peace treaty – one that recognizes the realities on the ground and rules out NATO membership for Ukraine. The consultations in Washington reached a dramatic climax when Trump picked up the phone to the Kremlin. Many saw it as a prelude to a potential three-way summit bringing together the US, Russia, and Ukraine. Moscow was more cautious: aide Yury Ushakov merely confirmed that the call touched on the idea of raising the level of negotiators on both sides. And so the true symbolic takeaway from Anchorage is not just that it happened, but that it signals a new phase. After decades of reflexive Cold War confrontation, Moscow and Washington are learning to navigate what might best be called a Cold Peace. Like an Alaskan summer, it feels chilly at first – northern, austere, forbidding. But stay awhile, and the frost gives way to a surprising warmth, a climate where coexistence, if not friendship, becomes possible.

The man, referred to only as Sergey K, was detained near Rimini on the basis of a European arrest warrant. German investigators believe he led a unit that blew up sections of the pipelines in September 2022. The attacks, which ruptured both the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines in the Baltic Sea, were, improbably, initially blamed on Russian operatives. But German prosecutors later traced a rented sailing yacht to the operation and linked it to Ukrainian nationals. Read more Poland to turn wind farm into NATO’s eyes and ears – media Investigators say Sergey K was part of a group that placed explosives on the pipelines near the island of Bornholm in September 2022. The accused was allegedly one of the coordinators of the operation. He and his accomplices are said to have used a sailing yacht that departed from the German city of Rostock. The vessel had previously been rented from a German company through intermediaries using forged identification documents. “After being transferred from Italy, the accused will be brought before the investigating judge of the Federal Court of Justice,” according to the statement by the prosecutor's office. Germany’s Federal Prosecutor General has reportedly been investigating the blasts for more than two years on suspicion of sabotage and causing explosives to be detonated. The explosions were seen at the time as an attack on critical energy infrastructure and a stark example of the rising economic fallout of the Ukraine conflict.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s plan to seize the city in order to achieve full control of Gaza was approved by the Jewish state's security cabinet two weeks ago. IDF spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin said on Wednesday that Israeli forces are already “holding the outskirts of Gaza City” and will “deepen” attacks on Palestinian armed group Hamas in the densely populated area. Netanyahu later said he had ordered the military to “shorten the timelines for seizing the last terror strongholds and for the defeat of Hamas.” The IDF is expected to present its plan for the capture of Gaza City to the prime minister on Thursday, military sources have told local media. Earlier this week, the IDF announced it would be calling up another 60,000 reservists ahead of the operation. Read more Netanyahu a ‘war hero’ – Trump Reports have also claimed that West Jerusalem has decided not to respond to Monday’s proposal by Hamas, which includes the release of ten Israeli hostages and a 60-day ceasefire. The offer was based on the framework by US President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, according to the group. Hamas said “the start of an operation against Gaza City and its nearly one million residents and displaced persons… demonstrates… a blatant disregard for the efforts made by the mediators.” On Wednesday, three IDF troops were wounded, including one severely, after 15 Hamas fighters emerged from tunnels and attacked them with firearms and anti-tank missiles near Khan Younis, south of Gaza City. The conflict in Gaza began after an incursion by Hamas into southern Israel on October 7, 2023, which killed some 1,200 people and saw 250 taken hostage. Around 50 of them remain in captivity. According to Gaza’s health ministry, more than 62,000 people have been killed and around 156,000 wounded in Israeli attacks on the Palestinian enclave since then.

According to the newspaper, Merz backs sending the German military to Ukraine, but the Social Democratic Party (SPD), which forms part of his ruling coalition, "as of now, will only support this if the US also takes the lead, providing its own troops.” Earlier this week, US President Donald Trump ruled out putting American boots on the ground in Ukraine. Bild also noted that if Ukraine were attacked while German troops were stationed there, Berlin would be in “uncharted legal territory.” Merz also has to grapple with strategic questions such as how many Western European troops could be deployed to Ukraine, how air surveillance and air protection would be ensured, and how Ukraine would maintain its military capabilities. Read more Germany’s Merz warns EU not to ‘overestimate’ influence on Ukraine conflict Publicly, Merz has not ruled out dispatching German soldiers to Ukraine, but has said “the whole of Europe should participate” in potential security guarantees to Kiev. “It is not just about the territory of Ukraine; it is about Europe's political order,” he added. Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul, however, has warned that Germany’s military capacity is already stretched to the limit. He noted it is currently the only European contributor with a combat-ready brigade stationed in Lithuania, and that simultaneously undertaking a mission in Ukraine “would probably be too much for us.” Although Trump has ruled out deploying US ground troops to Ukraine, he has signaled willingness to offer an air support framework if Moscow and Kiev reach an agreement to end hostilities. The Bild report follows the summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska last week, as well as a visit by Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky and several European leaders, including Merz, to Washington on Monday, with talks centered on settling the Ukraine conflict. Russia has warned that any NATO or Western troop presence in Ukraine would be absolutely “unacceptable,” regardless of its form or potential scenarios.
