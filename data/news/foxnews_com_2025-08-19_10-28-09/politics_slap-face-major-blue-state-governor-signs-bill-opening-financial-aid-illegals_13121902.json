    "article_summary": "Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, faces criticism for signing a bill that extends financial aid to illegal immigrants, with conservative Rep. Mary Miller calling it a \"slap in the face\" to Illinois families and students. The bill, sponsored by state Sen. Celina Villanueva, aims to provide financial aid to any student residing in Illinois, regardless of immigration status. Critics argue it drains taxpayer dollars and prioritizes illegal immigrants over residents.</s>"
