The group, consisting of special forces operatives supervised by Ukraine's military intelligence (GUR), was reportedly trained with the involvement of Western intelligence officers in Ukraine, Lithuania, Estonia, and Norway. The operation resulted in the seizure of weapons, explosives, and a communication device, and the arrest of several members, including the group's commander who confirmed having instructors from the UK, other European countries, and Canada.</s>"
