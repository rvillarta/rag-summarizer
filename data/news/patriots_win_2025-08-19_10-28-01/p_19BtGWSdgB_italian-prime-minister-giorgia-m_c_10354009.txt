It only took 6 hours in Brussels for her to sell out. permalink Jaybone86 1 points 4 hours ago How much is it that vs how much is it Europe in general are a collection of controlled democracies meaning the votes just don‚Äôt matter at all? permalink Sumar0ngi -16 points 10 hours ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink redredwine 9 points 9 hours ago It was shocking to hear President Trump gloating about wanting pedo and mass murderer Bill Gates on his Cabinet. Have you "NOTICED" the major similarity between WEF Klaus Schwab and the Rockefellers that Wikipedia forgets to mention? I've read about Bill Gates' mother names Maxwell being related to (Jeffrey Epstein) Ghislaine Maxwell, but haven't found enough info to prove it. permalink Friendly_B -1 points 8 hours ago ivermectinpepe alt I noticed! Klaus Martin Schwab was born on 30 March 1938, to Eugen Wilhelm Schwab and Erika Epprecht[4][5] in Ravensburg. His parents had moved from Switzerland to Germany during the Third Reich in order for his father to assume the role of director at Escher Wyss AG, an industrial company and contractor for the Nazi regime.[6][7] Although his father was baptized Lutheran,[8] Schwab was raised Catholic. permalink view 1 more comments...

America already knows. permalink FBJ_WoodChipper 3 points 10 hours ago America will never elect a woman.

I agree. Compared to other EU leaders however (like existing UK Germany, France) I'd take this little broad any day. permalink LiveFreeInXorDie 4 points 10 hours ago This. Supposedly, female rulers have been involved in more wars per capita than male ones. The only people women should be ruling over is their own children while their husbands are at work. permalink RStroud 0 points 9 hours ago Wonen have good PR, but they murder about 100m of their own children a year. For context thar is over 100x as many as armed conflicts and 10x cancer. Women unchained from consequence are by far the single most destructive force on the planet. If they, in their their private lives, see it as necessary to murder hundreds of millions of their own children what will they do to your nation and your children? permalink they-see-me-trollin PRO 2 points 6 hours ago but if she ever has a baby with Elon Musk, they need to name their baby Eloni Meloni. permalink Bullgod 34 points 9 hours ago She's no hero.
