She was part of a communist organization (when she was younger) that traveled to Cuba MULTIPLE TIMES to learn from Castro. Look it up. She's definitely a communist deep state mole, like the squad. permalink ESS4000 19 points 3 hours ago "Never let a crisis go to waste." permalink Owmyballz 11 points 3 hours ago "Always create a crisis to be able to exploit it". permalink The_Return_of_User_x 1 points 59 minutes ago They let the fires happen because if they put the fires out, nothing would be brought up to code. They want to enforce a green agenda but couldn't because there's were grandfathering rules in place to keep code enforcement at bay. Easier for them to let a disaster happen and enforce the codes afterwards. A house of sticks lasts forever if you replace the damage as you go... But if the whole thing burns down, I doubt you will build it out of sticks again. permalink Owmyballz 3 points 53 minutes ago No, I would build my new home out of Karen Bass's body rather than sticks. permalink hellohellohellohell 9 points 3 hours ago Does anyone have a link to that video from a month or two ago of a leaked conversation between Karen Bass and some donor right before the fires, telling him to calm down about some issue (having to do with housing, I believe) and that things would become apparent to him soon? I wonder if this video might help put that one in context? Edit: u/sorrytodisagree has it below, it was about low income housing: https://x.com/JamesOKeefeIII/status/1893037313602560293 permalink Snek_Plissken 1 points 31 minutes ago well they are buying up all the property to add more low incoming housing. I say she knew what she was doing. permalink NotYourMan 2 points 55 minutes ago Democrats buy the mayor and put in a DEI hire. The DEI hire is eternally loyal to the party over the people. This is the goal of dictators like democrats. permalink makesoutbaygr8again 5 points 2 hours ago Cuba Karen permalink BahamaDon 4 points 2 hours ago Not even a mole. Just outright in the open. permalink NotYourMan 1 points 56 minutes ago In a fair place, Karen Bass would have been impeached. But the democrat party conquered the state of California as soon as they could import millions of illegal aliens. Karen Bass is responsible for the disaster created by the fires. She did it because the democrat elites told her so that they could take property away from private citizens. This is one way that democrats work around prop 13. permalink sorrytodisagree 38 points 4 hours ago "Nothing they could do" or they wanted it to happen to clear the way for affordable housing projects? Remember her suspicious leaked call days before the fires... "Read in between the lines... hold tight, you will understand soon" permalink Hikedelics 12 points 3 hours ago ‚ÄúNothing they could do‚Äù but they were supposedly aware of an empty reservoir for over a year and of a litany of code violations that allegedly caused the fire to spread. So strange how they were simply unable to do any aspect of their jobs. permalink sorrytodisagree 7 points 3 hours ago They couldn't even "diversify" the leadership of the fire department beyond multiple lesbians named Kristen... permalink SavingPrivateGrace 23 points 3 hours ago Sad what happened to the people's homes and belongings and here's Boz, who sounds like Pee Wee Herman explaining your yards weren't up to code so they were too close together when built. Um, that's all the more reason water should have been on hand. Bass was in Africa getting delegates to come to LA, so her priority was about immigration, importing illegals and then providing them with delegates for what?? so they could set up little African villages in LA. I stopped listening 5 minutes in because Californians don't know how to take care of Californians and everyone wants to be a movie star best savior for the planet.

I left because I saw this coming. permalink Fusion360 11 points 4 hours ago Burn the old, build the new 15-minute cities. How many new buildings have you seen with apartments over retail? It's the game plan and it is still in operation. permalink FRONT_TOWARD_LEFT 4 points 2 hours ago I do not disagree with you on your point. Just FYI: They call those "town centers" around here (Northern Virginia). The attraction for developers is that retail and parking are built of steel and concrete on the lower floors, and the residential above is done with conventional wooden stick framing to however many floors local code allows without counting the steel/concrete lower floors against that limit. We have no shortage of hive-minded leftards willing to live in these insect colonies around here. permalink try4gain 1 points 51 minutes ago In the mid 2000s in Houston I lived in an older affordable apt in a decent part of town. The apt complex was made up of 3x different buildings all within 1 block of each other. They got the fancy idea to do what you mention. Tear down the old stuff and build some new 'apt over retail' higher end stuff. It was surely going to price us out. So they emptied the largest building and tore it down. Then found some Indian bones or something like that and so could not build shit on it. To this day that huge lot is still empty. Look up 3510 W Dallas St Houston Texas on Google maps. It was torn down 2007 or so. Lose income from kicking out tons of renters. Spend tons of cash tearing building down. Find Indians bones so now you cant re-build. ????

How in the hell do these guys answer straight up interview style questions and seriously consider that this chick (dude for some) is THAT interested in you!? Like how is talking about the mayor's plans and the failures of the wildfires not a giant red flag!? How are they THAT stupid!? permalink EndofQuote 2 points 2 hours ago Don't look a gift horse in the mouth, but it is pretty amazing how they just spill their guts. My guess is there are probably a lot of "dates" or whatever going on over time and a bunch of them probably do stay quiet, so OMG just keeps going until they find a loudmouth like that dude. permalink Illuminaughty 1 points 31 minutes ago Yup, you only hear the squeelers permalink utfanx2 6 points 3 hours ago Burn Loot Murder. permalink Bax101 6 points 3 hours ago I work for a public utilities company that bids contracts around the US. The Palisades was one of them before the fire. American Water Works and Microsoft Azure were also bidding. American Water Works bought Microsoft Azure cloud services in 2016. Microsoft Azure was busted with CCCP Engineers working the cloud based software. Why do you think Gavin Newsom and Bill Gates are working China? It's because they're working together for the future enslavement of our resources and control of AI. It's all about AI management and water resources. Any hack involving American Water Works is directly involved with China. Thanks to Bill Gates. This is a National security issue.
