They don't want to be called racist. permalink captflerbus -2 points 2 hours ago not this time apparently fake as fuck permalink CleanUpPhillyTrump24 2 points 2 hours ago Why are all the shills posting false claims of fakery on true posts that are showing anti-narrative proof? permalink hellohellohellohell -1 points 1 hour ago I actually WANT this to be real (just to illustrate to people how out of control things are getting), but it's clearly not. You're all over this thread claiming you know better than us, so cough up some links and prove us wrong. So I'll say it again, tell us what city this happened in? Show us the police report, or at least a legit news article. Give us the perps name. I did some Googling (using the date in the video), and I'm finding nothing. permalink TheOutlawPepeWales 4 points 4 hours ago If it was real there'd be a lot more "I know my rights" "I'm not under arrest" "fo wut" "call a supervisor" "it's because I'm black" "get your hands off me" "you're doing too much" "I can't breathe". . . permalink Crlsniper 1 points 29 minutes ago Thatâ€™s pretty much her attitude towards that whole thing though. Did you not watch it? permalink CleanUpPhillyTrump24 1 points 2 hours ago That is in the second video. permalink captflerbus 3 points 2 hours ago as fuck permalink CleanUpPhillyTrump24 1 points 2 hours ago There is part two where she gets arrested so it is very real. permalink MemeWarsVet -1 points 2 hours ago Yup. permalink Bullet3250 8 points 5 hours ago Hospitals rob you.... it's true. permalink Jakylangelo 6 points 5 hours ago Two in the back of the head. permalink Karma 5 points 4 hours ago Not likely an incapacitated person would have a Rolex on and cash nearby. Nursing homes discourage this. But my dad had sugar free snacks taken from him by a nurse who told him he could not have candy due to his diagnosis of diabetes. He argued with her but she removed them anyway. This was not part of her job to police her patients snacks. She had to open the door of his nightstand to find them which violated his privacy. She was later reprimanded and had to apologize. Families needs to advocate for loved ones in nursing homes daily. permalink 26magarat 6 points 4 hours ago Sounds like a Nurse Ratched type. permalink KartoffelPuffer 3 points 1 hour ago Not true. My parents (and other patients) had their expensive watches and rings on while in assisted living until they passed. permalink CleanUpPhillyTrump24 2 points 2 hours ago It is not uncommon for seniors to keep an expensive watch or ring that they wear in the hospital because they think they will be able to see if anyone tried to take it. permalink CleanUpPhillyTrump24 1 points 2 hours ago The thief gets arrested in the next vid frens. Just do a little research before you assert false falsehood. permalink NormalCitizen 5 points 4 hours ago Free vacation in El Salvador ðŸ˜˜ permalink ChyNahAzzWhole1 5 points 5 hours ago Build more prisons. permalink MapleMAGA 1 points 1 hour ago Rope is cheaper. permalink Mpower88 4 points 5 hours ago More wood chippers permalink 1777 4 points 3 hours ago Itâ€™s their culture. permalink Judgejude 3 points 4 hours ago Typical parasitic behavior. And the criminal reacted indignantly when caught in the act. Officer was enjoying the easy arrest. Notice the Tesla car she was driving. Paid for with welfare. Yep. All disgusting criminals even when employed. permalink KartoffelPuffer 2 points 1 hour ago Paid for with theft. permalink Louis_1313 1 points 3 hours ago Possibly fake, but too often too real elsewhere. The cop grabbing the cash was the fakest part for me, seemed REALLY staged permalink TraitorJoes 1 points 37 minutes ago Fake and non-heterosexual permalink Bastenogerino 1 points 2 hours ago There is one word. It starts with N and ends with igger. permalink Honkey_McCracker 1 points 20 minutes ago Accountable for nothing. Offended by everything. Just another Tuesday. permalink DJT4MoreYears 1 points 47 minutes ago Even if I didn't have any relatives left in life, I'd rather have my cash and watched buried with me rather than this criminal have it. Jail time bitch. This is why you never hire negros. permalink hellohellohellohell 1 points 5 hours ago Am I crazy, or does this seem fake? Not that this doesn't happen every day, but everyone in this video is melodramatic and speaks like they're trying to make it go viral. permalink newnewnewnew 3 points 5 hours ago thats how young people talk now, over-emoting like acting on camera is all they know permalink hellohellohellohell 1 points 5 hours ago Not cops, typically. Also, their word choices (especially the cop's) are odd. I'm going to try and look this up, it's too weird. permalink newnewnewnew 2 points 5 hours ago police know that these body camera channels have become very popular they know they are being watched as entertainment permalink CleanUpPhillyTrump24 1 points 2 hours ago Some cops in red cities don't have to worry about the Dem mayor coming after them for telling criminals the truth. permalink CleanUpPhillyTrump24 0 points 2 hours ago You are crazy. permalink hellohellohellohell 1 points 2 hours ago So tell us what city this happened in? Show us the police report, or at least a legit news article. Give us the perps name. I did some Googling (using the date in the video), and I'm finding nothing. C'mon, show us how crazy we are. permalink NukeTheNarrative 1 points 45 minutes ago We need "Big Daddy" energy when it comes to these criminally minded. We need more than "time out" for them (prison). We need "spanking's with a belt done in public" energy. When the low IQ criminally minded are TRULY scared of the consequences of being caught they will voluntarily reduce their criminal behaviors. It's all that works with some people. It's all that works. permalink CleanUpPhillyTrump24 1 points 2 hours ago All crimes against seniors = death penalty. Crimes against children and seniors = death penalty. It's irredeemable at that point. There's no coming back from it. permalink Louis_1313 1 points 3 hours ago I can think of one word Help me out chat permalink Righteous 1 points 2 hours ago N permalink FusionBlack 0 points 5 hours ago Fake and extra gay. permalink Oruin -3 points 4 hours ago Quit posting fake shit, you stupid faggot. permalink 259 There are no words to describe these people.
