It only leads to more and more taxes.

The weather in DC over the weekend sucked ass. Insanely hot and humid and some brief storms rolling through. They are comparing data to the same day last year. But the weather last year at this time was much better. I'm sure some illegals are staying away, but they can't afford to drink at these places anyway. These are the places where young 30-something overpaid lawyers and government workers go to waste their paycheck rather than pay back their student loans. permalink Skogin 1 points 37 minutes ago If they were dealing drugs and sex at the fag bar, that could explain their reaction. permalink ShadowInv 2 points 1 hour ago The prices are too high, and everyone moved to apps. permalink barwhack OP 2 points 1 hour ago The internet is for [gay] porn... --Vibes permalink JoeBidensDementia1 2 points 26 minutes ago How many businesses closed permanently because of muh COVID?

I thought the homos would appreciate a little enrichment from imported diversity. It's like the blind opening of a mystery gift box. permalink barwhack OP 3 points 1 hour ago That was my point: it seems they are complaining BECAUSE THEY ARE SAFE. permalink CleanUpPhillyTrump24 2 points 1 hour ago "Go out" and buy drugs, get high, have open sex in parks with male prostitues, you know, the DC party life. permalink Snek_Plissken 2 points 34 minutes ago Well, when you take away peoples income through crime they have less spending cash. permalink rootGoose 2 points 18 minutes ago They admit the LGBTQ community is full of criminals. permalink barwhack OP 2 points 16 minutes ago ... or just [at best] full of pedo-adjacent masochists.
