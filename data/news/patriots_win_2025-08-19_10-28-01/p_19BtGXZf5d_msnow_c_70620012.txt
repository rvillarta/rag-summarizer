Amazing how a college dropout has become a billionaire expert in population control (I mean vaccines, chemicals and propaganda) permalink War_Hamster 4 points 3 hours ago It helps when you father was on the board for eugenics org Planned Parenthood. permalink snoopy3210 2 points 2 hours ago What was his formula?

Hemminwesque brevity. permalink Gunmolester 11 points 4 hours ago more like BS NOW permalink throwaway777b 9 points 3 hours ago The bigger picture no one is seeing, is that the MSNBC brand is so toxic, that it's killing the parent Brand of just NBC. NBC probably forced this on MSNBC, because the association does more damage to NBC than it helps the causes they care about. An unprofitable NBC can't engage in culture wars when it can't make money and stopped getting un-earned USAID. permalink bigleaguetrump 2 points 2 hours ago Exactly, imagine if Fox News dropped Fox from their name. The MSM would be talking about how the network Fox was ashamed of having their name associated with them. permalink barwhack 1 points 1 hour ago Then they'd just be named "Lies"... permalink spezisacuckold 2 points 40 minutes ago It‚Äôs pronounced ‚Äúfaux‚Äù permalink notsuicidalatall 1 points 3 hours ago In my eyes NBC didn't need MSnbc to sour it with most conservatives. Look at their lineup, shows like New Amsterdam where they had a story line about enabling a minor to get gender changing surgery. It was all about telling the parents they were wrong to fight it. Don't be fooled by then name change. Notice "Opinion" in the new name. This is more their way to categorize their propaganda as opinion as not to get in hot water with more lawsuits from President Trump. Just my 2cents. permalink BirthHole 1 points 21 minutes ago Yes. It's part of the overall pivot of corporate media back to the appearance of being impartial. 60 thru 80's style news coverage. permalink philasoma 9 points 4 hours ago Just use a picture of Rachel Maddow.

As in: if they say it, something opposing is likely being covered up. permalink SavingPrivateGrace 2 points 3 hours ago None the producers deserve to continue in broadcasting. The shame on us is that no one was arrested for pushing the lie that was the stolen election of 2020. No, they just get rebrand with more lies on top of more lies and are getting dark money somehow funneled through the underbelly of the DNC beast. The dark money is more concerning now more than ever because this is what they do with it....rebrand. permalink Kermit 1 points 2 hours ago Lot of strange things happening with Liberal talking-heads just after the demise of USAID. I'm sure it's not related. permalink MEME-SUPREME 1 points 2 hours ago PMS NOW permalink MAGALADON9 1 points 2 hours ago MS Now sounds like a multiple sclerosis charity permalink preferredfault 1 points 3 hours ago It's not even a good name change. But really isn't just a symptom that these companies aren't actually news companies, they're just mouthpieces. No one who actually cared about viewer and profits would actually do half the stuff they've done, and especially not this retarded generic name change. It's just another sign that they don't need to care about these things because they're entirely astroturfed. Fake news, fake viewers, fake funding. permalink PhilipeNegro 1 points 2 hours ago Art style: humanistic, organic, nuanced Labeling: kept to a minimum Background: stark, to focus you on the concept 10/10 editorial illustration. As I write this, Ben Garrison is individually labeling the turds in his toilet so the septic tank knows what they are. permalink PhantomShield72 1 points 2 hours ago MS SOW permalink DragonKP 1 points 2 hours ago More Shit Now permalink cross_bearer_02 1 points 1 hour ago MSNOPE permalink 886 MSNOW ü§°üåé HONK HONK üåéü§° posted 4 hours ago by Trick 41 comments √ó
