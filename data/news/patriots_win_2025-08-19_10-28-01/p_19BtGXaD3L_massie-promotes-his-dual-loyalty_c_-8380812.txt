198 Massie Promotes His "Dual Loyalty Disclosure Act" posted 2 hours ago by flashersenpai 27 comments Thomas Massie @RepThomasMassie ‚Ä¢ 6h Good morning! Today would be a great day to tell your representative to cosponsor my Dual Loyalty Disclosure Act (HR 2356). If dual citizens run for office, they should disclose ALL countries in which they hold citizenship. Don‚Äôt you agree? 27 comments Greenhills 17 points 2 hours ago As if they don‚Äôt openly declare their loyalty to other countries now. permalink TruculentGoose 9 points 2 hours ago So sick of the constant Isreal deep throating. Still waiting to hear one single benefit they provide to the US permalink TakingCoatsWIN 4 points 1 hour ago How is he deep throating Israel? He's exposing how dumb this bill is since it doesn't stop dual citizenship in govt and dual citizenship holders already flaunt their dual citizenship. Just Massie trying to score brownie points acting like he is doing something when the bill does absolutely nothing, typical politician all talk no action, but makes people like you think he is "fighting" for something. What the fuck does "disclosing" dual citizenship do when they already proudly claim they have dual citizenship? Let me know when there's a bill BANNING dual citizenship in govt. permalink IncredibleMrE1 3 points 50 minutes ago Exactly Also, what about political donations from dual citizens, that is at least as big of a problem. permalink TallestSkill -1 points 38 minutes ago That tiny Asian country you mentioned only ranks 3rd for most dual citizens in congress. The European Union is the greatest abuser of the dualality loophole with Mexico in 2nd. I am sick of the unhinged hate derailing policy discussions because lonely autistic incels can only discuss one topic. This is a Trump forum for Trump supporters, not a right wing catch all for bigotry and hate permalink deleted -3 points 51 minutes ago TruculentGoose 2 points 44 minutes ago Are you upset because you cant name one single benefit Isreal "our greatest ally" provides to the US? permalink TallestSkill 0 points 39 minutes ago Massie Promotes His "Dual Loyalty Disclosure Act" Good morning!

Formerlurker92 2 points 47 minutes ago Hell, we've got natural born citizens declaring their loyalty to foreign nations. All those Ukraine flag waving retards, Johnson in Israel, aoc for Palestine All of that should be frowned upon permalink Jakylangelo 8 points 1 hour ago DUAL CITIZENS CANNOT RUN FOR ANY POSITION IN THE GOVERNMENT‚Ä¶ NOT EVEN A FUCKING JANITO.R permalink South_Florida_Guy 6 points 57 minutes ago They shouldn't even be allowed to run in the first place permalink flashersenpai OP 4 points 2 hours ago https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/2356/cosponsors Only 6 other house members have cosponored the bill: Biggs, Clay, Greene, Begich, and Nehls permalink Formerlurker92 2 points 48 minutes ago Mexicans and Indians will be big mad about this one permalink EvilGreed209 2 points 2 hours ago Why bother we know they all signed the pledge Israel First but less than a hand ful.. The House wins permalink Agent_86 1 points 2 hours ago Nothing wrong with standing with Israel. Having dual citizenship should disqualify anyone from elected service. Everywhere. permalink NukeTheNarrative 1 points 56 minutes ago Good to see you saying this. In some way feels symbolic of a tide turning in the world of ideas. permalink farfiman 1 points 15 minutes ago This is good move but won't change what many people think since there are zero members with dual citizenship with Israel. permalink HumblePig 1 points 14 minutes ago Not even remotely controversial. permalink mygovisacommie 1 points 39 minutes ago I‚Äôll take it a step further. Their dual citizenship should be disclosed ON THE BALLOT. permalink StoneRealist 1 points 38 minutes ago They shoulfdnt be allowed to run tbh permalink dude_bro 1 points 1 hour ago "Americans Fly One Flag" Jim Jordan permalink ThongsOfRussia 1 points 54 minutes ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink 198 Massie Promotes His "Dual Loyalty Disclosure Act" posted 2 hours ago by flashersenpai 27 comments Thomas Massie @RepThomasMassie ‚Ä¢ 6h Good morning!
