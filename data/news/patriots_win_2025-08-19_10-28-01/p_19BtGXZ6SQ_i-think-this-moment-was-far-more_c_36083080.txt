There is no ‚Äústatute of limitations‚Äù issue. There is no excuse for not indicting everyone who was involved in J13, the secret service (those involved) on the ground, SS leadership, other law enforcement, elected officials who conspired, FBI who met with the kid, whomever spoke to this kid, transferred payment into his overseas accounts, placed the puts against Trump owned entities just before, and those involved at CNN who decided to cover the rally live, etc. permalink MySidesGoUp 24 points 6 hours ago Over 40% of the country ‚Äúworks‚Äù for govt‚Ä¶ permalink HKgoneWild 14 points 5 hours ago And what percentage doesn't work at all and persists on gibs? permalink 45fan 10 points 5 hours ago He did say "government", didn't he? permalink view 1 more comments...

At all? As i understand it Trump came out of the meeting with ‚Äúgive Russia most of what they‚Äôve taken and they‚Äôll stop.‚Äù Which is a far cry from how he was talking a month ago. permalink Decepticons-superior 9 points 3 hours ago Sorry but Russia has the moral high ground in this war. How would we like it if China (or Russia) installed a puppet leader in Mexico, built 14 bio labs all over the country, and then tried to get Mexico to join a military alliance thats sole purpose is to stop American imperialism? Think we‚Äôd have a problem with that? permalink Zippitydoodah 4 points 3 hours ago Exactly!! Western globalist faggots took control of Ukraine back in the "orange revolution" and then the Euromaiden, and have been using it as a personal money laundering service ever since.

If you want to believe something as retarded as putin made trump his bitch, there are other forums for you. permalink DaayTerkErJerbs 3 points 2 hours ago Thats the only deal your going to get. How is that hard to understand. That lands gone. Ukraine couldnt move the lines nor stop advancement with 500 billion in weapons, all of nato helping as advisors, an Ukraine lost all their fighting aged males. Nothing short of US going in to take we it back will work an nobody in the US cares enough to die for it. It's not our problem. The only thing u can do at this point is hope Russia stops taking more land. Thats the best option u have. Next time don't fuck around or yah might find out. Western countries wrote papers 25 years ago saying if the US tried to move into Ukraine Russia would respond. So they moved into Ukraine an Rissia responded. They knew it would happen an rolled the dice anyways. Bunch of jackasses. permalink Klaus73 -1 points 2 hours ago Its not a matter of understanding; as you put it; unless the US is willing to put up a fight then Russia wins; that's all there is to it. The important thing to recognize is that Russia wins and the US isn't going to resist that. I don't necessarily see this as 100% bad; but folks got to stop acting like countries invading other countries is generally acceptable and that a country is somehow in the wrong for going down swinging; if the shoe was on the other foot and it was the US I wouldn't expect you guys to give up a few states either. I don't like Z-bee but I can relate to his position he is in because the Ukrainians got something they call theirs and now its being torn from their hands and you got a 3rd party saying to just let them keep it; but I see little incentive for them to cease aggressions for more then a few years. I know the US doesn't like to hear this but being Schrodinger's tough guy is becoming less and less effective. The US often brags how it protects the world and keeps the peace through its military might; but Russia just pointed out it was an act and called the US bluff - they will gladly take only a bit of territory for now; just in the same way the democrats only took a "few" laws for now - slowly pushing the boundaries further and further. permalink BallotsOnRubysUSB 10 points 3 hours ago Ô∏é That little midget D I C T A T O R Zelensky was flying around in the U.S. only one or two weeks before the Butler rally like he was in a coke binge.

Ô∏é Zelensky, ( & Biden? ), maybe working with the CIA/MI6. Ô∏é permalink ColoRobo 13 points 5 hours ago That‚Äôs not what they‚Äôre saying.

Before Zelenskyy, we had an election stole by foreign bad acting countries that called us ‚ÄúFriends.‚Äù You do recall a fuss about a lot of money would be lost by Trump winning in 2020 and taking office, right? If so, was there any change or do they stand to lose more money? I would bet a lot more now. I believe Trump is pissed but in a happy way. permalink RealmanPwns 4 points 4 hours ago The "interpretation" was " And all the leaders look like they just saw a ghost." - I just don't see that when I watch. There was no mention of Z wanting Trump killed in this post. permalink Sgt_Hulka 1 points 4 hours ago No. Zelenskyy is a muppet. He wouldn‚Äôt have the balls to do anything like that.

A bunch of people here saying it was a 4d chess move by Trump when all it looked liked was an awkward moment during a photo with the other leaders. permalink tflst5 10 points 6 hours ago Its a total alpha move. He is basically saying to them - people will remember me, i'm a part of history. you will all be forgotten. This meeting was the EU negotiating its surrender. They've been facilitating this war with Russia.. after being the ones to goad Russia into it. They failed to break Russia.. and then they lost the US's support.

They may have even known in advance that Trump was to be assassinated, though I doubt any but the UK or Zelensky could have been active participants in the attempt.
