I wasn't even allowed to work for over a month during the scamdenic and I lost all of my clients. My mother died in a⁹ nursing home and they wouldn't let us go see her for 6 months before she died. I didn't qualify for any type of loans or grants. I had 2 kids in college. I had to prematurely withdraw money from my IRA to pay expenses. They owe me in fucking spades. We need Justice. permalink USDMaga 4 points 3 hours ago I actually had some lib impersonate a friend of mine to try and find out what PPP loans I abused illegally. Never took one. It was so bad an impersonation I just ignored. I often wonder how many people they got doing that. permalink Gildoom 3 points 1 hour ago But she had me audited over 88 dollars that the IRS told me I could deduct, not kidding. I was a victim of the IRS targeting people who didn't agree correctly with Heir Obama the Gay. permalink Retard_Strength 1 points 2 minutes ago invested in Gay Hammer Fights, LLC permalink MAGALADON9 1 points 2 hours ago Stern letters permalink BobSacano 1 points 3 hours ago Comment removed by community filter, pending further review. permalink BobSacano 1 points 3 hours ago Comment removed by community filter, pending further review. permalink 282 Paul Pelosi took out two PPP COVID relief loans for $711,708 and $996,392.
