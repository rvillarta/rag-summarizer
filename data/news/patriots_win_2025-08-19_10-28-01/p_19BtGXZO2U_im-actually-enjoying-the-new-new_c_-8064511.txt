Too bad the people that support him are too stupid to realize. permalink TommyLasordasBallBag 18 points 5 hours ago Wait... there are people who support him? Could have fooled me... and I live in California. permalink CyanScales OP 15 points 4 hours ago It's hard to know how many. Enough hate him that he was recalled, but somehow he was allowed to ignore it? I was sure they had enough signatures. permalink trumpORbust 5 points 4 hours ago Just once, right? permalink AcquittedZombieSlay 4 points 3 hours ago When it came time to vote, he cheated using fake ballots printed in China. permalink rebuildingMyself 2 points 4 hours ago I'm sure illegals love him permalink HunterBidensPC 2 points 5 hours ago You could tell them but they will fight you to keep you from making them fact check you permalink BlackFolk 0 points 2 hours ago How did you manage to misspell it twice? permalink IForgotToAddAnEmail 17 points 5 hours ago This place must be bored. permalink WassermanSchultz 22 points 4 hours ago Just killing time until all the arrests start... permalink KernalMustard 12 points 4 hours ago Its been 84 years. permalink HikingPatriot 7 points 4 hours ago 2 more weeks permalink Viewer01 3 points 4 hours ago https://x.com/crazybonezskele/status/996438529952698368?s=46 permalink Tophat9000 8 points 4 hours ago RFK jr needs to look in the newsome cuz I've never seen a more ultra processed artificially colored product in the history of the world permalink BlackFolk 1 points 2 hours ago Thereâ€™s only one e in Newsom. permalink brainphreeze 6 points 4 hours ago It plays to their base, they find it hilarious. The difference is that POTUS comes up with his social media posts himself, whereas faggot sociopath Newsom has zero input - his team of faggots create their posts with AI permalink x79q3pb 2 points 1 hour ago Prompt: write me a response to [paste] in the spirit of Donald Trump. permalink barwhack 4 points 5 hours ago Retarded Gay Faggotry: The Verneer permalink Klaus73 4 points 4 hours ago The fact the public discourse has degenerated this far makes me weep for the future...idiocracy will look like the Bonfire of the vanities at this point. permalink Retard_Strength 1 points 9 minutes ago who will be the first to propose the name change to the House O' Representin' - AOC or Crockett? permalink nemurinokogoro2 3 points 4 hours ago The more attention you give this faggot intern and his Twitter account the happier he is permalink jsphere256 3 points 3 hours ago Just like we drew it up permalink Bullet3250 3 points 5 hours ago yep - Newsome is 'Fighting' the Deep State.... kek. permalink newnewnewnew 9 points 4 hours ago he's not alluding to fighting it. he's mocking its existence. it shows he is about as out of touch as andrew cuomo not a single american in either party doubts the existence of an unaccountable government that acts against their interests permalink CyanScales OP 5 points 4 hours ago Amazing all the changes after USAID was cut off. permalink MagaJay02 2 points 4 hours ago Anyone who mocks the notion of a deep state can't simultaneously argue that lobbyists have power lol. Because that's all deep state is. Unelected governance behind the scenes. Basically the main purpose of lobbying. Blackmail, lobbying, money, "who you know", family lineage... all things that make deep states exist. Deep states even exist within public companions. permalink Klaus73 1 points 4 hours ago Your not wrong. The problem is that "Deep State" has become a cure-all excuse for any failing. Clearly the reason bad things happen is never due to bad decisions; its a shadow cabal operating to sabotage - rather then simply the fact that people might disagree. I've seen deep-state thrown around to essentially justify any failure. permalink newnewnewnew 1 points 4 hours ago it becomes difficult to differentiate between the two because the main purpose of the deep state is to protect government institutions and their survival at all costs. bad decisions and failures by the government are not acknowledged or corrected so protecting those failures to protect government essentially becomes sabotage permalink view 1 more comments... noPTSDforMePlease 1 points 4 hours ago He's not out of touch, he is the deep state. And he needs to mock it for it to continue to give him power. If people took it seriously then they would all be arrested. permalink Scot 1 points 5 hours ago "For". Fighting for the deep state. permalink HumblePepe 2 points 4 hours ago The account should be banned as per X's rules because it does have the satire tag. permalink SavingPrivateGrace 2 points 4 hours ago Gavin Newsom wants to be a social media influencer with fake bots and fake followers because no one really talks to him in real life. He is trying to appeal to the young generation but all he has is illegals, fags and tranny's and they are the most filthy, lying, cheating, manipulators on the interwebs. permalink CyanScales OP 2 points 5 hours ago https://x.com/thereal_Osborne/status/1957640202907972062?t=8FiDDjH_pur1irgzADP5qw&s=19 permalink hughjasske69 1 points 4 hours ago Fake permalink 636 I'm actually enjoying the new Newsome account.
