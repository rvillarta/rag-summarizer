Its likely never occurred to them, its other people paying for their food. permalink RuprechtThaMonkeyBoy 20 points 6 hours ago Itâ€™s time for state, county, and city-level DOGE-style investigations. permalink HKgoneWild 10 points 5 hours ago Unless they're going to actually start hanging, or at minimum imprisoning, these corrupt bastards nothing will change. Local county fucks someone over? After the legal system battle, the person wronged might get a payout from the county at taxpayer expense. Until the government officials, elected or otherwise, face personal accountability for their actions nothing will change. permalink Bullet3250 OP 2 points 6 hours ago ðŸ’¯ permalink aqua27 12 points 6 hours ago Eliminate all these programs they are full of criminal activity.
