That is why Colbert getting fired rules! permalink NavyPat 19 points 2 hours ago The ‚ÄúNews‚Äù is useless. BOYCOTT them. permalink Dwoj 18 points 2 hours ago Well they are the enemy not actual news sources. Once people know that, yes, they are being defeated and will provide no assistance to help President Trump. permalink SavingPrivateGrace 10 points 2 hours ago They have gone bankrupt in essence. They are running on dark money to stay afloat as the last resort to the DNC Party. They just have to do it long enough to manipulate and cheat Midterm elections and then the gravy train will flow again, so they believe. They need Power and they will get it at all costs, they're desperate and dying. permalink CANATIVE 4 points 24 minutes ago Die faster please permalink Skogin 4 points 35 minutes ago It‚Äôs high time to finish them. permalink knnbccb 7 points 1 hour ago Since they are no longer doing journalism, they should be stripped of all access, privileges and protection given to journalists. As you go further along dealing with voting fraud, eventually you have to deal with the so-called media too. Because it is also part of the voting fraud, no less so than Dominion machines or mail-in-voting, or laughably biased redistricting. permalink OrangeElvis 1 points 1 hour ago 100%! permalink notsuicidalatall 6 points 2 hours ago Fuck John Roberts permalink ImpeachThisBitch 2 points 1 hour ago Beat me to it. Can‚Äôt say it enough though. Fuck John Roberts. permalink TDmaga 1 points 1 hour ago Why? Not familiar with the background permalink ImpeachThisBitch 3 points 29 minutes ago Turned on Trump many times. Especially with the election interference. permalink Tim_Berframer 5 points 2 hours ago Works4me. C ya. permalink John_Smallberries 5 points 1 hour ago Very very few people under the age of 40 watch the ‚Äúnews.‚Äù It‚Äôs in a death spiral so we shouldn‚Äôt pay much attention to what they have to say. They‚Äôre irrelevant. permalink Skogin 1 points 33 minutes ago They are irrelevant, apart from all the seniors that own most of the country and watch MSM everyday. permalink DoctoeDS 2 points 1 hour ago Fake news aka globalist propaganda... ofc they will not cover or will distort everything. If Trump gets peace they will just say he's a puppet working for putin. Imagine if it was Obama.... 10 nobel peace prizes.... "the great peacemaker". permalink Cyer6 1 points 1 hour ago We're dealing with people who will see the country burn to the ground just because. There is no compromise and they're all in. permalink BallotsOnRubysUSB 1 points 2 hours ago Ô∏é Who's the midget in the middle? Ô∏é permalink goodtimebox 4 points 2 hours ago Just a lil' crackhead. permalink barwhack 1 points 2 hours ago I also prefer that they fail and go bankrupt. Regardless of their future coverage quality. permalink excelance 1 points 1 hour ago I'd prefer that, but they'll never go bankrupt; they get NGO and government money to stay afloat. I'm sure USAID was just the tip of the iceberg. permalink Yignuced 1 points 2 hours ago Of course they would. His success is their likely imprisonment. permalink StoneRealist 1 points 1 hour ago Trump hasn't won anything in regard to this matter yet. permalink cross_bearer_02 1 points 2 hours ago And nothing of value would be lost. Consign them to the dustbin of history where they belong. permalink Pede 1 points 1 hour ago Wait those last two guys in line are NATO? Those are some powerful mysterious guys to be standing alongside the leaders of countries. permalink MemeForTheWin 1 points 1 hour ago links are stupid permalink MythArcana 1 points 2 hours ago Well, we're waiting... permalink ValuesLiberty 1 points 2 hours ago Aren't whites still being slaughtered over there?
