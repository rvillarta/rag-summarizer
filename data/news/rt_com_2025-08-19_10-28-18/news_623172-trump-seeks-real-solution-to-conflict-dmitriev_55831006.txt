His comment came ahead of Monday’s White House meeting between Trump, Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky, and several European leaders. Trump has described the upcoming talks as a “big day,” saying he has “never had so many European leaders at one time.” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, and the heads of the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Finland, and other EU institutions are expected to join Zelensky in Washington. On X, Dmitriev praised Trump for “pushing for the real solution” to the conflict and voiced hope that “problem solving and peace prevail during the Big Day.” Read more EU leaders to join Zelensky in US after Trump ‘thwarted’ their plans – Bild The envoy was part of the Russian delegation at last week’s Alaska summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which both sides described as substantive and warm. Following the talks, Trump said he favored a permanent peace deal rather than a ceasefire. Moscow has long opposed short-term truces, arguing they could be exploited by Kiev to regroup and rearm. The German outlet Bild reported that Trump’s shift has “thwarted” Kiev’s backers who have insisted that a ceasefire should come first. Dmitriev said over the weekend that this group was “in full panic mode” at the prospect of closer US-Russian cooperation on a settlement. He also noted Bild’s suggestion that Western European leaders were accompanying Zelensky to Washington in order to prevent a repeat of his heated clash with Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance during his February visit. Putin has reiterated that any lasting settlement must eliminate the root causes of the conflict, address Russia’s security concerns, and recognize current territorial realities. Washington has echoed the view that a sustainable peace, rather than a temporary truce, is essential. Zelensky, meanwhile, has continued to insist on a ceasefire as a prerequisite for talks and has ruled out any land swaps, citing Ukraine’s constitution.

Trump made the remarks on Tuesday after a meeting in Washington with Zelensky, several European leaders, and the heads of NATO and the European Commission. The discussions centered on conditions for a possible peace deal with Russia. The talks followed Trump’s summit with Putin in Alaska last week. In a phone interview with Fox News, Trump claimed he had resolved “seven wars” during his political career but described the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as the toughest one yet. Trump, who wants to arrange a meeting between Putin and Zelensky, expressed hope that the Ukrainian leader “will do what he has to do,” adding that “He has to show some flexibility.” Trump had earlier suggested that a trilateral meeting with Putin and Zelensky could be held soon, saying “there will be a reasonable chance of ending the war when we do that.” Trump met Putin on Friday in Anchorage, Alaska, in their first face-to-face encounter since 2019 in the American president’s first term. He described the talks as “warm,” while Putin called them “frank” and “substantive.” He followed up on Monday with a phone call to the Russian president, briefing him on the talks in Washington. According to the Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov, the call lasted 40 minutes, with both sides expressing readiness to continue discussions on a resolution with Zelensky.

While both leaders welcomed the “warm” and “constructive” talks, the aftermath saw Trump and his officials, notably envoy Steve Witkoff, reveal Washington’s sense that a breakthrough was possible. Vladimir Zelensky was then summoned to the US capital to discuss a deal that could reportedly involve territorial exchanges, recognition of the existing front lines and international security guarantees. He arrived accompanied by his key Western European backers, for a bilateral with Trump and a wider discussion. While much of the talk around the talks should be regarded with suspicion, especially from the Western commentariat, here are some of RT’s key takeaways from the recent developments.

Following a weekend during which Putin was welcomed to the US by President Donald Trump, who days later hosted Vladimir Zelensky and his key Western European backers, Moscow confirmed its readiness to participate in further talks on a lasting resolution to the Ukraine conflict and indicated that its diplomatic presence at such talks would be raised. A possible venue for such talks has not been identified. The Hague-based ICC issued arrest warrants in 2023 for Putin, as well as Russian Commissioner for Children’s Rights Maria Lvova-Belova, over alleged unlawful deportation and transfer of children from former Ukrainian territories. Moscow has dismissed the allegations as politically motivated, explaining that it evacuated the children out of the war zone for their own safety. On Tuesday, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis told a press conference that, under certain circumstances, the Russian president would be allowed to set foot in Switzerland. The Swiss government last year defined “the rules for granting immunity to a person under an international arrest warrant. If this person comes for a peace conference – not if they come for private reasons,” Cassis said as quoted by various news outlets.

French President Emmanuel Macron, who also took part in Monday’s talks with Trump, has reportedly raised the possibility of a peace summit being held in “a neutral country, maybe Switzerland.” “I’m pushing for Geneva,” he told French news channel LCI on Tuesday.
