18 Aug, 2025 22:32 Home World News What could bring 21 million people into the streets of Iraq? They walk for days under the sun, driven by grief and resistance – turning an ancient tragedy into the world’s most powerful act of faith Arbaeen is one of the world’s most significant and massive religious events. It commemorates the tragic death of Imam Hussein – the son of Imam Ali and grandson of the Prophet Muhammad. In Iraq, Arbaeen is far more than a religious ritual. It is a powerful social, cultural, and spiritual gathering that draws millions of pilgrims from around the globe. This year, officials counted 21,103,524 arrivals. For many Shiites, the journey begins weeks before the date itself. They set out on foot from towns and cities across Iraq and from neighboring countries – primarily Iran, Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, and Lebanon. Pilgrims also come from Africa, Asia, Türkiye, Europe, and even Russia. Russians, in fact, are easy to spot: they often arrive with a giant tricolor flag. © Abbas Juma Blessing in motion An Arab proverb says: “There is blessing in movement.” In Shiite civilization, movement carries special weight. Walking forward is seen as a way of resisting decline and backsliding. That’s why the centuries-old tradition of walking the roughly 80 kilometers from Najaf to Karbala has survived – interrupted only during Saddam Hussein’s rule, when Shia Islam came under harsh political repression. As Iraqis say today: that was just a moment, and it means nothing now. “Saddam Hussein and the Baath Party waged a real war against Shiite Muslims,” recalls Sayyid Mohammad al-Yasri, head of the local branch of the Dawa Party in Najaf. We met in his spacious home, where he described life for believers under Saddam. Both he and his father had lived through years of persecution before Iraq was once again able to host millions of pilgrims each year. “The regime banned rituals, ceremonies, even prayers,” he explained. “Shiites were forbidden to travel to Karbala. That ban carried political weight, because Arbaeen has always been a symbol of the struggle for the rights of the oppressed. History remembers the ‘Arbaeen Intifada’ of 1977, when worshippers were gunned down by tanks right outside Karbala. Yet people never gave up Arbaeen. They went underground, resisted the regime, and held to their faith.” Abbas Juma and head of the local branch of the Dawa Party in Najaf Sayyid Mohammad al-Yasri © Abbas Juma “Saddam was brutal. He launched a war with Iran, poisoned Iraq’s foreign ties, and crushed his own people. We wanted to end that ourselves. But then the Americans came." “We never wanted change to come through them – it had to be the Iraqi people’s decision. We fought politically, and some of us militarily, until we finally forced the Americans out in 2011. But even then, they came back through ISIS. So Saddam is gone, but sectarian strife still plagues us. That’s the card the West plays – the US and Israel. We want unity. If our nation is united, there’s no room for Israeli aggression. Division is their goal; unity is the true path.” Scale and Organization Unlike the Hajj, in which pilgrims travel to Mecca, Arbaeen is exclusively a Shiite pilgrimage. Attendance in Karbala routinely ranges from 17 to 25 million, making it one of the largest religious gatherings on Earth. Pilgrims endure days of exhaustion, blistering heat that often tops 120°F, and all kinds of discomfort. Many believe the hardship itself is part of the test – a trial of will. Still, today’s journey is far easier than it was for their grandparents. Along the way, pilgrims are fed and given water, offered free medical care, and sheltered in tents known as mukeb. © Abbas Juma In recent years, especially since Hamas’s attack on Israel in October 2023, the Palestinian cause has become a central theme of Arbaeen. The Palestinian mukeb is more than a rest stop: it’s a museum dedicated to the Palestinian struggle and the Resistance movement. Inside are exhibits, a broadcast studio, a podcast space, a dining hall, and a clinic. For Shiites, the war in Gaza resonates deeply with the events of 680 A.D., when Hussein ibn Ali and his followers were killed in battle against the forces of Yazid ibn Muawiya. Believers see Yazid in today’s Israel and the United States, and they argue that although 1,400 years have passed, the struggle continues – an eternal battle between light and darkness, the oppressed and the oppressor, good and evil. This philosophy underpins both the Resistance movement and modern Iran’s political vision, even as the country still reels from its 12-day war with Israel. © Abbas Juma Security and sacrifice “After 2003, Iraq faced major security challenges,” says Iraqi lawyer Zaid Jabbar. “Shiite pilgrims heading to Karbala during Arbaeen were regularly attacked by suicide bombers, often from groups like al-Qaeda. They used car bombs and improvised explosives. Hundreds died each year. But after 2014, once the People’s Pilgrimage Authority was formed, the government reorganized everything and finally secured the entire route." “Even with pilgrims now arriving from Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Turkey, Russia, and Europe, security has held. Iraq spends billions providing food, water, and lodging so pilgrims can stay for free. Wealthy Iraqis donate livestock, vegetables, fruit, and sweets.” From what I saw this year, security is tighter than ever. Nobody enters Karbala without a thorough inspection. Every pocket is checked, every pill in a medicine kit examined. Just a year ago, such measures seemed impossible, and the only answer to how Iraq avoided chaos or attacks was: “by the grace of God .” © Abbas Juma Today, it’s also by the work of tens of thousands of volunteers who set aside their lives to build camps, cook meals, pour drinks, and keep order. They do it freely, out of faith, but also in hope of reward in the afterlife. You can see the joy on a volunteer’s face when you accept food from their hands — as if, in that moment, a good deed has been tallied in their favor in heaven. The tribal factor On my last day in Iraq, I visited Sheikh Amir, leader of the powerful Bani Hassan tribe, in his home. In Iraq, tribes can number in the millions, making their sheikhs wealthy and politically influential. If a tribe stretches beyond Iraq’s borders – into Saudi Arabia, for example – its leader’s influence can become regional. Q: What role do tribes play in Iraq’s political and social life? A: “The Bani Hassan and Iraq’s tribes in general are the backbone of society. They have always played an effective role in every Iraqi government. Tribes became institutions of the state – ensuring security in provinces and regions, especially when police were absent. They are closely tied to religious and political leaders. Their cohesion has been vital to Iraq’s stability. Tribes reject destructive forces, fight drugs, and support the state against terrorism. While we have our own customs, the law comes first. Anything illegal is also against tribal norms.” Sheikh Amir, leader of the powerful Bani Hassan tribe © Abbas Juma Q: What happens if a sheikh disagrees with the prime minister? A: “That has never happened. As I said, the law is supreme, and its authority extends even over the sheikhs. We live by the law.” Q: And what role do tribes play in Arbaeen? A: “A central one. The Bani Hassan tribe, in particular, has a special position because of its location on both banks of the Euphrates, near Imam Hussein’s shrine. We provide pilgrims with everything they need, day and night.” The larger picture Beyond its spiritual meaning, Arbaeen brings tangible benefits to Iraq. It strengthens Shiite identity across the region, fosters intercommunal dialogue, and, at least for a time, narrows the gap between rich and poor. Arguments are set aside, divisions blur, and people come together. In a sense, Arbaeen provides not just a religious release, but also a social one.

Trump made the remarks on Tuesday after a meeting in Washington with Zelensky, several European leaders, and the heads of NATO and the European Commission. The discussions centered on conditions for a possible peace deal with Russia. The talks followed Trump’s summit with Putin in Alaska last week. In a phone interview with Fox News, Trump claimed he had resolved “seven wars” during his political career but described the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as the toughest one yet. Trump, who wants to arrange a meeting between Putin and Zelensky, expressed hope that the Ukrainian leader “will do what he has to do,” adding that “He has to show some flexibility.” Trump had earlier suggested that a trilateral meeting with Putin and Zelensky could be held soon, saying “there will be a reasonable chance of ending the war when we do that.” Trump met Putin on Friday in Anchorage, Alaska, in their first face-to-face encounter since 2019 in the American president’s first term. He described the talks as “warm,” while Putin called them “frank” and “substantive.” He followed up on Monday with a phone call to the Russian president, briefing him on the talks in Washington. According to the Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov, the call lasted 40 minutes, with both sides expressing readiness to continue discussions on a resolution with Zelensky.

While both leaders welcomed the “warm” and “constructive” talks, the aftermath saw Trump and his officials, notably envoy Steve Witkoff, reveal Washington’s sense that a breakthrough was possible. Vladimir Zelensky was then summoned to the US capital to discuss a deal that could reportedly involve territorial exchanges, recognition of the existing front lines and international security guarantees. He arrived accompanied by his key Western European backers, for a bilateral with Trump and a wider discussion. While much of the talk around the talks should be regarded with suspicion, especially from the Western commentariat, here are some of RT’s key takeaways from the recent developments.

Following a weekend during which Putin was welcomed to the US by President Donald Trump, who days later hosted Vladimir Zelensky and his key Western European backers, Moscow confirmed its readiness to participate in further talks on a lasting resolution to the Ukraine conflict and indicated that its diplomatic presence at such talks would be raised. A possible venue for such talks has not been identified. The Hague-based ICC issued arrest warrants in 2023 for Putin, as well as Russian Commissioner for Children’s Rights Maria Lvova-Belova, over alleged unlawful deportation and transfer of children from former Ukrainian territories. Moscow has dismissed the allegations as politically motivated, explaining that it evacuated the children out of the war zone for their own safety. On Tuesday, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis told a press conference that, under certain circumstances, the Russian president would be allowed to set foot in Switzerland. The Swiss government last year defined “the rules for granting immunity to a person under an international arrest warrant. If this person comes for a peace conference – not if they come for private reasons,” Cassis said as quoted by various news outlets.

French President Emmanuel Macron, who also took part in Monday’s talks with Trump, has reportedly raised the possibility of a peace summit being held in “a neutral country, maybe Switzerland.” “I’m pushing for Geneva,” he told French news channel LCI on Tuesday.
