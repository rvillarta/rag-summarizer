18 Aug, 2025 18:06 Home World News Ukraine must forget about Crimea and NATO – Trump The US president has set the conditions for a peace deal between Kiev and Moscow ahead of talks with Zelensky and European leaders US President Donald Trump. © Andrew Harnik/Getty Images US President Donald Trump has outlined terms for a peace deal between Kiev and Moscow that would require Ukraine to abandon its NATO ambitions and accept Crimea as part of Russia. The announcement came on Truth Social on Sunday, two days after Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, where both reaffirmed their commitment to resolving the Ukraine conflict. Trump is meeting Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky and senior European leaders in Washington on Monday. Trump wrote that Zelensky “can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight.” A settlement, he added, would require “no getting back... Crimea” and “no going into NATO by Ukraine.” Crimea became part of Russia in 2014 after the peninsula’s population overwhelmingly supported the move in a referendum while Kiev prosecuted a war against its own eastern regions. Moscow insists that a lasting settlement would require Kiev to renounce its desire for NATO membership, demilitarize, and recognize the new territorial reality on the ground, including the status of Crimea, Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson, and Zaporozhye Regions, all of which have voted to become parts of Russia. Zelensky has consistently rejected territorial concessions. He wrote after Trump’s post on X that it was “Russia [that] must end this war, which it itself started,” adding that “Crimea should not have been given up then.” This is Zelensky’s first White House visit since a stormy February encounter with Trump and US Vice President J.D. Vance. He will be joined by European leaders, including France’s Emmanuel Macron, Germany’s Friedrich Merz, Britain’s Keir Starmer, and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen. Trump has indicated that if Monday’s talks succeed he will push for a trilateral summit with Putin and Zelensky as early as Friday. Putin has not ruled out direct talks with Zelensky, but stressed that they must be preceded by significant progress toward a settlement. Moscow has voiced concerns about Zelensky’s right to sign any binding agreement, given that his presidential term expired last year and that he has refused to call a new election, citing martial law.

Trump made the remarks on Tuesday after a meeting in Washington with Zelensky, several European leaders, and the heads of NATO and the European Commission. The discussions centered on conditions for a possible peace deal with Russia. The talks followed Trump’s summit with Putin in Alaska last week. In a phone interview with Fox News, Trump claimed he had resolved “seven wars” during his political career but described the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as the toughest one yet. Trump, who wants to arrange a meeting between Putin and Zelensky, expressed hope that the Ukrainian leader “will do what he has to do,” adding that “He has to show some flexibility.” Trump had earlier suggested that a trilateral meeting with Putin and Zelensky could be held soon, saying “there will be a reasonable chance of ending the war when we do that.” Trump met Putin on Friday in Anchorage, Alaska, in their first face-to-face encounter since 2019 in the American president’s first term. He described the talks as “warm,” while Putin called them “frank” and “substantive.” He followed up on Monday with a phone call to the Russian president, briefing him on the talks in Washington. According to the Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov, the call lasted 40 minutes, with both sides expressing readiness to continue discussions on a resolution with Zelensky.

While both leaders welcomed the “warm” and “constructive” talks, the aftermath saw Trump and his officials, notably envoy Steve Witkoff, reveal Washington’s sense that a breakthrough was possible. Vladimir Zelensky was then summoned to the US capital to discuss a deal that could reportedly involve territorial exchanges, recognition of the existing front lines and international security guarantees. He arrived accompanied by his key Western European backers, for a bilateral with Trump and a wider discussion. While much of the talk around the talks should be regarded with suspicion, especially from the Western commentariat, here are some of RT’s key takeaways from the recent developments.

Following a weekend during which Putin was welcomed to the US by President Donald Trump, who days later hosted Vladimir Zelensky and his key Western European backers, Moscow confirmed its readiness to participate in further talks on a lasting resolution to the Ukraine conflict and indicated that its diplomatic presence at such talks would be raised. A possible venue for such talks has not been identified. The Hague-based ICC issued arrest warrants in 2023 for Putin, as well as Russian Commissioner for Children’s Rights Maria Lvova-Belova, over alleged unlawful deportation and transfer of children from former Ukrainian territories. Moscow has dismissed the allegations as politically motivated, explaining that it evacuated the children out of the war zone for their own safety. On Tuesday, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis told a press conference that, under certain circumstances, the Russian president would be allowed to set foot in Switzerland. The Swiss government last year defined “the rules for granting immunity to a person under an international arrest warrant. If this person comes for a peace conference – not if they come for private reasons,” Cassis said as quoted by various news outlets.

French President Emmanuel Macron, who also took part in Monday’s talks with Trump, has reportedly raised the possibility of a peace summit being held in “a neutral country, maybe Switzerland.” “I’m pushing for Geneva,” he told French news channel LCI on Tuesday.
