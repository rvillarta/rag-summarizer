Trump wrote on Sunday that Zelensky “can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight.” He added that a settlement would require “no getting back… Crimea” and “no going into NATO by Ukraine.” About ninety minutes later, Zelensky responded on X, making clear that “not Ukraine, but Russia must end this war, which it itself started. And I hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will force Russia into a real peace.” Read more Zelensky could end conflict ‘immediately’ – Trump Zelensky then declared that “I am confident that we will defend Ukraine.” “Of course, Crimea should not have been given up then, just as Ukrainians did not give up Kiev, Odessa, or Kharkov after 2022,” he added. Crimea officially became part of Russia in 2014 after the peninsula’s population overwhelmingly supported the move in a referendum while Kiev prosecuted a war against its own eastern regions. Despite refusing to make concessions, the Ukrainian leader thanked Trump for the “invite” to the White House and insisted that he and the US president “share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably.” Zelensky is coming to Washington following Friday’s summit in Alaska between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump, at which both leaders underlined their commitment to resolving the Ukraine conflict.

According to the Russian side, for lasting peace to be achieved, Ukraine should renounce its aspiration for NATO membership, demilitarize, and recognize the current territorial realities; including the status of Crimea, as well as of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, the latter four of which voted to join Russia in 2022.

Trump made the remarks on Tuesday after a meeting in Washington with Zelensky, several European leaders, and the heads of NATO and the European Commission. The discussions centered on conditions for a possible peace deal with Russia. The talks followed Trump’s summit with Putin in Alaska last week. In a phone interview with Fox News, Trump claimed he had resolved “seven wars” during his political career but described the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as the toughest one yet. Trump, who wants to arrange a meeting between Putin and Zelensky, expressed hope that the Ukrainian leader “will do what he has to do,” adding that “He has to show some flexibility.” Trump had earlier suggested that a trilateral meeting with Putin and Zelensky could be held soon, saying “there will be a reasonable chance of ending the war when we do that.” Trump met Putin on Friday in Anchorage, Alaska, in their first face-to-face encounter since 2019 in the American president’s first term. He described the talks as “warm,” while Putin called them “frank” and “substantive.” He followed up on Monday with a phone call to the Russian president, briefing him on the talks in Washington. According to the Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov, the call lasted 40 minutes, with both sides expressing readiness to continue discussions on a resolution with Zelensky.

While both leaders welcomed the “warm” and “constructive” talks, the aftermath saw Trump and his officials, notably envoy Steve Witkoff, reveal Washington’s sense that a breakthrough was possible. Vladimir Zelensky was then summoned to the US capital to discuss a deal that could reportedly involve territorial exchanges, recognition of the existing front lines and international security guarantees. He arrived accompanied by his key Western European backers, for a bilateral with Trump and a wider discussion. While much of the talk around the talks should be regarded with suspicion, especially from the Western commentariat, here are some of RT’s key takeaways from the recent developments.

Following a weekend during which Putin was welcomed to the US by President Donald Trump, who days later hosted Vladimir Zelensky and his key Western European backers, Moscow confirmed its readiness to participate in further talks on a lasting resolution to the Ukraine conflict and indicated that its diplomatic presence at such talks would be raised. A possible venue for such talks has not been identified. The Hague-based ICC issued arrest warrants in 2023 for Putin, as well as Russian Commissioner for Children’s Rights Maria Lvova-Belova, over alleged unlawful deportation and transfer of children from former Ukrainian territories. Moscow has dismissed the allegations as politically motivated, explaining that it evacuated the children out of the war zone for their own safety. On Tuesday, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis told a press conference that, under certain circumstances, the Russian president would be allowed to set foot in Switzerland. The Swiss government last year defined “the rules for granting immunity to a person under an international arrest warrant. If this person comes for a peace conference – not if they come for private reasons,” Cassis said as quoted by various news outlets.

French President Emmanuel Macron, who also took part in Monday’s talks with Trump, has reportedly raised the possibility of a peace summit being held in “a neutral country, maybe Switzerland.” “I’m pushing for Geneva,” he told French news channel LCI on Tuesday.
