    "article_summary": "US President Donald Trump has suggested that Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky could end the conflict with Russia \"immediately\" by agreeing to a peace deal that excludes NATO membership and involves territorial concessions. The proposed deal could involve Ukraine giving up its positions in Donbass while freezing battle lines elsewhere in exchange for a halt to hostilities. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin recently held talks, expressing cautious optimism about resolving the hostilities between Moscow and Kiev. However, Zelensky has insisted that Crimea and other regions remain Ukrainian and has rejected any compromise.</s>"
