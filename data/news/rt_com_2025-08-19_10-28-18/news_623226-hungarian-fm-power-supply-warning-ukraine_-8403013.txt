18 Aug, 2025 19:13 Home World News EU state hints at cutting off power supply to Ukraine Peter Szijjarto has accused Kiev of undermining Hungary’s energy security after an attack on a pipeline carrying Russian oil to the country Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto. © Klaudia Radecka/NurPhoto via Getty Images Hungary could cut off power supply to Ukraine in response to a recent attack on a pipeline carrying Russian oil to the EU state, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has suggested. Unlike most EU countries, Budapest has refused to provide military aid to Kiev, and has been a vocal critic of the bloc’s sanctions against Russia. Hungary’s relations with Ukraine have been steadily deteriorating in recent years, with Budapest accusing Kiev of discriminating against the Hungarian ethnic minority in Western Ukraine. In a post on X on Monday, Szijjarto stated that while “Russia has supplied oil to Hungary for decades via the Druzhba pipeline,” Ukraine “attacks this pipeline, and because of these Ukrainian strikes, oil supplies to Hungary are repeatedly cut off.” The diplomat stressed that Kiev’s actions go directly against his country’s national interests. Szijjarto went on to warn Kiev that a “significant part of Ukraine’s electricity comes from Hungary…” The remark came in response to a statement by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrey Sibiga. In an X post earlier on Monday, Sibiga wrote that “Hungary has made every effort to maintain its reliance on Russia,” even after the Ukraine conflict escalated in February 2022, and despite being “told for years that Moscow is an unreliable partner.” READ MORE: EU leaders want to overthrow three European governments – Budapest “You can now send your complaints – and threats – to your friends in Moscow,” Sibiga told Szijjarto. In an earlier message, the Hungarian official claimed that the “outrageous and unacceptable” Ukrainian attack on the conduit was part of concerted efforts by Kiev and Brussels to “drag Hungary into the war in Ukraine.” The previous attack on Druzhba happened as recently as last week. Druzhba is one of the world’s longest networks, transporting crude some 4,000km (2,485 miles) from Russia and Kazakhstan to the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia. Commenting on the latest attack on the pipeline, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova suggested that the current Ukrainian leadership poses a threat to all neighboring nations, with Moscow having repeatedly warned about that since the 2014 Western-backed Maidan coup.

Trump made the remarks on Tuesday after a meeting in Washington with Zelensky, several European leaders, and the heads of NATO and the European Commission. The discussions centered on conditions for a possible peace deal with Russia. The talks followed Trump’s summit with Putin in Alaska last week. In a phone interview with Fox News, Trump claimed he had resolved “seven wars” during his political career but described the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as the toughest one yet. Trump, who wants to arrange a meeting between Putin and Zelensky, expressed hope that the Ukrainian leader “will do what he has to do,” adding that “He has to show some flexibility.” Trump had earlier suggested that a trilateral meeting with Putin and Zelensky could be held soon, saying “there will be a reasonable chance of ending the war when we do that.” Trump met Putin on Friday in Anchorage, Alaska, in their first face-to-face encounter since 2019 in the American president’s first term. He described the talks as “warm,” while Putin called them “frank” and “substantive.” He followed up on Monday with a phone call to the Russian president, briefing him on the talks in Washington. According to the Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov, the call lasted 40 minutes, with both sides expressing readiness to continue discussions on a resolution with Zelensky.

While both leaders welcomed the “warm” and “constructive” talks, the aftermath saw Trump and his officials, notably envoy Steve Witkoff, reveal Washington’s sense that a breakthrough was possible. Vladimir Zelensky was then summoned to the US capital to discuss a deal that could reportedly involve territorial exchanges, recognition of the existing front lines and international security guarantees. He arrived accompanied by his key Western European backers, for a bilateral with Trump and a wider discussion. While much of the talk around the talks should be regarded with suspicion, especially from the Western commentariat, here are some of RT’s key takeaways from the recent developments.

Following a weekend during which Putin was welcomed to the US by President Donald Trump, who days later hosted Vladimir Zelensky and his key Western European backers, Moscow confirmed its readiness to participate in further talks on a lasting resolution to the Ukraine conflict and indicated that its diplomatic presence at such talks would be raised. A possible venue for such talks has not been identified. The Hague-based ICC issued arrest warrants in 2023 for Putin, as well as Russian Commissioner for Children’s Rights Maria Lvova-Belova, over alleged unlawful deportation and transfer of children from former Ukrainian territories. Moscow has dismissed the allegations as politically motivated, explaining that it evacuated the children out of the war zone for their own safety. On Tuesday, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis told a press conference that, under certain circumstances, the Russian president would be allowed to set foot in Switzerland. The Swiss government last year defined “the rules for granting immunity to a person under an international arrest warrant. If this person comes for a peace conference – not if they come for private reasons,” Cassis said as quoted by various news outlets.

French President Emmanuel Macron, who also took part in Monday’s talks with Trump, has reportedly raised the possibility of a peace summit being held in “a neutral country, maybe Switzerland.” “I’m pushing for Geneva,” he told French news channel LCI on Tuesday.
