The 12th edition of The World Games closed on Sunday night in Chengdu, southwest China's Sichuan Province.
The Games, featuring 34 sports, 60 disciplines and 256 events, ran from August 7 to 17 under the slogan "Boundless Sports, Countless Wonders." China sent a 489-member delegation, its largest in the event's history.
China has achieved its best-ever performance at the Games, topping both the gold and overall medal tables for the first time.
The Games drew unprecedented participation, with 6,679 athletes, team officials and technical officials from 116 countries and regions.
Operations were supported by a 4,600-member competition management team, 1,133 technical officials and 13,000 venue staff. Technical support was provided by 27 specialist teams maintaining more than 20,000 pieces of equipment across 579 categories, along with 150 staff members managing timing and scoring systems. More than 6,000 volunteers also contributed.
International World Games Association Vice President Tom Dielen praised the "unprecedented athletic performances" and the event's organization.
"It has been a true home, a place with sporting experts and cultural exchanges. We were faced not only with impeccable organization and flawless operations, but also with the warmth and hospitality that is uniquely Chinese. The first-ever torch relay and spectacular opening ceremony were definitely defining moments which should have set a new benchmark," he said.
