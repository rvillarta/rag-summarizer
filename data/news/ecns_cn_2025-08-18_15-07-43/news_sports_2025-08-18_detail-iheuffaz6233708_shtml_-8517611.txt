With the extinguishing of the main torch, the 12th World Games drew to a close in Chengdu, Sichuan province, on Sunday night, drawing widespread acclaim as participants and spectators alike left with fond memories.
Addressing the closing ceremony, Jose Perurena, president of the International World Games Association, extended his gratitude to all parties involved in hosting the Chengdu games for their contribution.
"With warm hospitality, remarkable efficiency and the impeccable delivery of these games, Chengdu has set new standards for the future," he said.
Shi Xiaolin, president of the games' organizing committee and governor of Sichuan, said, "Chengdu makes dreams come true," adding that she looks forward to welcoming more friends back to the splendid and leisurely land of Sichuan to experience its natural beauty, diverse culture and its development in the new era.
Held at the Chengdu International Friendship Pavilion in the Chengdu World Horticultural Expo Park, the closing ceremony embodied the spirit of "promoting global solidarity" and highlighted Chengdu's unique charm as a "park city".
The World Games, held every four years, is the highest-level international multisport event that mainly features non-Olympic sports.
One of the most significant achievements of the Chengdu games was the integration of traditional Chinese sports such as dragon boat and wushu into the competition schedule, said Perurena, the IWGA president, at a press conference earlier on Sunday.
"These sports carry a profound cultural heritage and are a source of great pride for China," he said, adding that dragon boat and wushu will remain part of the World Games program.
Hailing the high standard of excellence in the games' organization, Tom Dielen, vice-president of IWGA, said the first-ever torch relay and the magnificent opening ceremony were truly milestone moments that have set a new benchmark.
"From the moment we arrived, we experienced not only impeccable organization and smooth operations but also a unique Chinese warmth and hospitality," he said.
Dielen emphasized that the games' legacy will continue to inspire future generations as the IWGA has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Chengdu Sport University to jointly establish a center for sports research and promotion.
This landmark initiative aims to advance non-Olympic sports in China and globally, he added.
At the closing ceremony, the IWGA flag was handed to a representative of Karlsruhe, Germany, which will host the 13th World Games in 2029.
The 11-day Chengdu games drew a record 3,942 athletes from 116 countries and regions to compete in 256 events across 34 sports, including floorball, flying disc and air sports.
A total of 18 world records were set in the games as of Saturday. China made history by topping the medal tally with 36 golds, 17 silvers and 11 bronzes.
"Amazing" and "magnificent" were among the words that athletes and officials from around the world used the most to describe their experiences during the Chengdu games.
"I am blown away," said Gisella Bonomi, an athlete from the gold-winning Argentine women's beach handball team. "The event is more than successful. It's magnificent!"
"Chengdu's technology, culture and way of living are inspiring," Bonomi said, adding that she felt like a little girl going through an adventure park.
Sydney Martin, a gold medalist from the United States cheerleading pom doubles team, said she and her teammates had a memorable experience visiting giant pandas and exploring different parts of Chengdu.
"We took a boat cruise, ate hotpot and watched Sichuan Opera. These were all things we never expected before we came, and it was truly amazing," she said.
Meanwhile, many niche sports found new fans in China thanks to the Chengdu games.
Alexander Kallai, a representative of the International Casting Sport Federation, said his federation's promotion in Chengdu during the games attracted local residents across all age groups.
"Casting has much in common with recreational angling, and given China's massive angling community, we see tremendous potential for its growth here," he said.
Ran Jiaqing, a student at the Civil Aviation Flight University of China and a volunteer at the games, said he tried all the niche sports at The World Games Plaza during breaks.
"The games have ignited my and my schoolmates' passion for niche sports," he said.
Xu Xingguo, executive vice-president and secretary-general of the games executive committee and vice-mayor of Chengdu, said that while preparing for The World Games, the city launched experience programs for the featured sports in over 1,000 communities.
Chengdu has also incorporated sports such as flag football and breaking into the curricula of 130 local schools, reaching more than 50,000 students, Xu said.
The proportion of Chengdu citizens participating in emerging trendy sports has reached 18 percent, he added.
