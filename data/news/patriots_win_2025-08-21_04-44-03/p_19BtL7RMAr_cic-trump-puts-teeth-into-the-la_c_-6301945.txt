People who hire illegals are traitors on a local level. We used to shun people who would do shit like that permalink FrmrAmericanRepublic 21 points 7 hours ago They should take that fucking dead-eyed turban turd and strap him to the front of a truck and slam it into a fucking concrete wall. Then the biz that hired this fucker should be stripped of any ability to ever have one again, and the CEO and officers imprisoned. I mean all the way banned. permalink MayorMcSixaplix 7 points 7 hours ago Even better: slam him into the newly painted black border wall. permalink dukeofdoorcounty 3 points 1 hour ago You mean the shell company owned by another shell company that has the same address as 100 other shell companies? permalink Whozat 2 points 58 minutes ago Yep. They will be up and running in a week with a new name but same trucks. permalink Whozat 2 points 59 minutes ago They live in the town next to me. They are all illegal indians. permalink Standingoak 13 points 8 hours ago Dose "shun" = tar & feather ? permalink Wtf_socialismreally 8 points 7 hours ago No, it means you don't bake them cake. permalink thevagabond 3 points 6 hours ago No, we're not Murderers and Vigilantes. This isn't batman. but we can shun those businesses. The businesses can be prosecuted. reach out. do the needful. permalink Standingoak 2 points 5 hours ago Just melt the tar next time . Don't boil it like when we throw it over the parapets🙄 permalink mikethemarine 2 points 2 hours ago I came to say this, get rid of H1B, cause this just makes them ALL feel like if they can do it so can I permalink thevagabond 6 points 6 hours ago AND WE WILL AGAIN BROTHER. JUST FIND THEM OUT. SHAME THEM. AND DESTROY THEM FOR THEIR DECISIONS permalink hellohellohellohell 26 points 7 hours ago If they unleashed a massive H1b, illegal hiring, offshoring crackdown right now, it would basically nullify the petulant "hiring freeze" BlackRock types are trying to perpetrate now. permalink thevagabond 12 points 6 hours ago THIS IS THE WAY, WE HAVE TO PUT PRESSURE ON TRUMP TO DUMP H1B. IT'S GOT TO BE DONE. THERE IS NO OTHER WAY. WE NEED AMERICAN JOBS FOR AMERICANS. permalink Side_o_beef_curtains 1 points 54 minutes ago This. India did just piss him off. Now is the time. permalink whataboob 1 points 7 hours ago Petulant hiring freeze? permalink hellohellohellohell 3 points 6 hours ago https://patriots.win/p/19BtGb0UsQ/bad-job-market-news--the-hiring-/c/ permalink Hanging_Chad 24 points 8 hours ago legals’ wages go up 📈 permalink whataboob 10 points 7 hours ago How about the US government who shipped them in here in front of us?! permalink PatriotSkorzeny 6 points 8 hours ago But not the ones that treacherously let him in, or gave him a license? Only the American civilian must be punished in any way for the actions of the “brave men and women”. Got it. permalink whataboob -8 points 7 hours ago This whole site seems like some Democrat plot to drive Americans to fight illegals, as if illegals who were SHIPPED IN HERE BY THE US GOVERNMENT are the enemy… I watched how the US government bussed and flew these people in, and now I’m supposed to be mad at them? Sure, deport, but not getting one ounce of emotion from me over this except maybe sorrow for what our county is doing to these people, using them as pawns in a sick political game. I often feel like I shouldn’t be on this site cuz it’s mostly “dey took err jorbs!!” Mouth breather morons who obsess about illegals all day while forgetting who did this and other vile shit to us. By the way, WHILE THEY IMPORTED MILLION OF POOR PEOPLE ON TOP OF US, they also poisoned millions of Americans with some chemical they kept pretending was medicine (it wasn’t!). Trump still touts OPERATION WARP SPEED as an amazing success. permalink SavingPrivateGrace 65 points 8 hours ago That was fast action. This is the kind of response and timing we need. permalink HunterBidensPC 18 points 8 hours ago Agreed I wanted swift deportation and punishment for those who hired him and I’m happy with the result. permalink Yeti2 12 points 7 hours ago Also jail those that let or brought them in. permalink _Eric_Ciaramella_ 8 points 4 hours ago and the clerks at the dmv who knowingly gave him a license permalink MAGALOVER 6 points 4 hours ago ^^^ THIS right here, Eric !!! I want every one of the fat, lazy, rude DEI hires at the DMV that give illegals driver's licenses FIRED. permalink whataboob -10 points 7 hours ago Ok, another “obsess with illegals at the cost of American rights obsession” bot. The US government shipped these people in, it’s on video in case you forgot who the real enemy is. And now Americans have to lose their businesses and freedom because of this attack on our population by our own government? By the way, I remind again the illegal obsessed mouth breathers on this ever saddening site, that THE US GOVERNMENT ALSO POISONED US WITH SOME CHEMICAL WHILE THEY SHIPPED IN MILLIONS OF ILLEGALS! But this is all in vain. The government did this to us cuz it could cuz look at you people — the government gives you a basic bitch distraction with some Mexicans, and what do you do? You get deeply distracted by some Mexicans, just as they wanted you to be. permalink guywholikesDjtof2024 10 points 7 hours ago that was Biden admin. you are stuck in october 2024. get upgraded. you apparently think trump is biden. permalink Drewniverse 4 points 5 hours ago Wow a whatabob bot imposter. permalink whataboob -1 points 1 hour ago I can put two sentences together and I’m not a retard that gobbles up every fake news article so I must be a bot. Says something about you. permalink view 2 more comments... AlaskanCentipede 3 points 5 hours ago Two things can be true If a hitman breaks into my house and murders my wife, I'm mad at both the hitman AND the neighbor who hired him. The hitman doesn't get a pass just because he was "just doing his job" and someone paid for him to be there Of course, the neighbor doesn't get a pass either just because he farmed out a crime to another person Illegals need to go back to whatever shithole country they were flown out of and the government rats who brought them here also need to be punished but the illegals don't get to stay here and keep committing violent crimes just because the feds engineered their arrivals permalink whataboob 0 points 1 hour ago Yeah, I hear that, I’d be mad at the hitman too. But the analogy is more like you’re on a sinking ship called the USA, and there’s a giant hole in the ship called the US government, and you’re using a little cup to scoop the water out of the ship as it fills much faster than you and your friends can empty it with your little cups. And I’m saying “let’s focus on the hole before we bother with the water…” And y’all just wet af, with your face beep in the waters ass, like “look at this f illegal bot pos, gtfo here Mexican!!” 🇺🇸 permalink Madnote1984 4 points 6 hours ago It's one of the best solutions. I predicted/suggested this very thing in a thread yesterday. https://patriots.win/c/TheDonald/p/19BtGYhVFG/ Now they just need to follow through with the rest of my suggestions and they can solve this issue. permalink JimmyRussler 3 points 8 hours ago Don't worry I'm sure there's a judge who will be just as quick to overrule it. permalink PatPede1 2 points 2 hours ago Probably, but the business deserves the hassle until they demonstrate they aren’t hiring absolutely incompetent illegal aliens to fatten their profits. They can now spend their profits on lawyers, watch their insurance become unaffordable and cancelled, get sued into oblivion by the family of the three dead and likely decapitated innocents, and on & on. permalink kishkan 41 points 8 hours ago Not only should the business license be revoked, the company assets should be seized. The family without a doubt should be suing this company into bankruptcy with the government holding the assets. permalink The_Emperor 11 points 6 hours ago The victims may civilly sue, inded. Not the government. permalink Threaper666 3 points 4 hours ago I read the article and it said that California broke its own laws by giving him a license. How the fck does that work? permalink whataboob -5 points 7 hours ago Exactly as the constitution says lol permalink MedicallyReddit 32 points 8 hours ago Poopjeets do NOT belong in America. permalink Klown_Kutz -1 points 2 hours ago It’s Poojews. permalink whataboob -19 points 7 hours ago You sound retarded. You make deportation seem bad. permalink Afeazo 12 points 7 hours ago Can’t tell if you’re a jeet or jew, not like there’s much difference to be honest. permalink Prandogolio 28 points 8 hours ago I learned on Salty Cracker today the motherfucker couldn't even speak English and failed to answer 10 out of 12 verbal questions correctly for his certification but got a certification anyway permalink mullethawk 2 points 2 hours ago He's talking about the english language proficiency test they gave him after the crash. You don't actually have to know english to pass the CDL exam and get a commercial driver's license, but I suspect that's about to change. permalink AgnosticTemplar 5 points 1 hour ago He was also asked to explain what road signs meant and could only identify a quarter of them. That's revelant to obtaining a CDL. permalink Original_Dankster 1 points 9 minutes ago The driving school he attended and the official who administered his exam need to be investigated permalink mullethawk 0 points 42 minutes ago Actually it's not because the written exam can be administered in foreign languages. It's relevant to passing the English Language Proficiency test but they don't give you that test while obtaining a CDL. The only CDL test that's in English with no translators allowed is the driving test. The only English you need to know for that is "turn left here, turn right here, when it's safe to do so change lanes, take the next exit," etc... permalink whataboob -20 points 7 hours ago … ? Why is your focus on “the motherfucker” when your whole government, country, and local systems are all involved in doing this? You know the guy was shipped in here by our government, right? Did everyone forget? permalink FatigueIsReal 11 points 7 hours ago His focus is on the motherfucker being given a certification, i.e. the corrupt system. Same as you. No one forgot. permalink _Eric_Ciaramella_ 4 points 4 hours ago hes a leftwing retarded troll permalink Wrexxis780 0 points 5 hours ago I am always surprised when random people think we can't hate on more than one motherfucker at the same time. permalink guywholikesDjtof2024 4 points 7 hours ago is unable to accept that trump won in nov 2024 and still thinks biden is in power permalink Snek_Plissken 2 points 5 hours ago Washington State the liberal hell hole gave him a CDL. California failed to stop him from driving when he transferred his CDL there and couldn’t speak the language. Then the shit fucker company clearly hired an inept street shitter that wasn’t legally allow to drive a truck in the US due to legal status. They certainly didn’t file an i9. permalink ADAM_SCHITT 14 points 8 hours ago Since when does the federal government give out business licenses? It also doesnt mention revoking the license in the article at all, other than the headline. This sounds like another gateway pundit fake news. permalink Robsantosid 24 points 8 hours ago They used the wrong terminology, they revoked the companies “authority” which in effect is a license to haul freight. It’s issued federally. permalink hey_spike 14 points 8 hours ago Transporting goods across state lines seems like something legitimately covered by the interstate commerce clause in the constitution. permalink JerryJerryJerry 7 points 6 hours ago Interstate trucking definitely involves DOT. permalink BidenShowerDrool 5 points 8 hours ago perhaps it's the federally issued Employer Identification Number of the business which gets put on ice and hence the business is now dead in the water. Either way the business has ton of new headaches and law-fare to fight. permalink STRONGLYWORDEDLETTER 1 points 6 hours ago Maybe revoking the EIN? permalink MythArcana 13 points 8 hours ago Inb4 Newsom gives all California residents CDLs. permalink Jackthereaper0015 10 points 7 hours ago I will refrain from celebrating knowing full well these asshats will simply create another operation under a different set of fake names like they have in the past. permalink agave_lime 8 points 6 hours ago The family has other companies in other states. They don't need their license revoked, they need to be imprisoned. permalink CLF3 7 points 5 hours ago This will do absolutely nothing. If this company follows the same trends as the others follow they already have a backup MC/USDOT number gaining age and in approximately 30 days they will take their door stickers off the trucks, put new ones on, and continue to operate under a new name as if nothing changed. Aside from extra dot numbers gaining age some companies already operate multiple LLCs just in case. Instead of 150 trucks under one company they spread them out by 20s or 50s. Depending on how much they can tolerate to lose if shit hits the fan. permalink Tunk 3 points 3 hours ago Yeah, an investigation needs to follow the trucks, see which companies have previously owned them. Take all the cancelled/closed companies, and permanently bar any owners/directors, and their family from receiving new permits/licenses and close down existing ones that are marinading. Revoke licenses for drivers that were used by those companies too, and deport any deportables. Seize the trucks while they are at it. Its amazing how often indians get away with shell gaming things like this. Seen it happen in construction, education, and small business (gas stations, restaurants, convenience stores, taxi etc), always several companies on the go. If there are legal problems, shutdown, transfer assets, phoenix under another for a blank slate. Takes decades for regulators to catch up to them, if they ever do. By then they've used their multitude of companies to provide sponsorship to their friends and family, who join in on the matryoshka doll of companies to keep them rolling. They are really good at abusing high trust systems, with low trust values. permalink CalVotesMatter 1 points 2 hours ago Here is their backup MC. They seem to have several already. MC-1185567 permalink mullethawk 1 points 2 hours ago Or they will just illegally buy another immigrant company's DOT number. permalink Abovethefray 6 points 7 hours ago The Babylon Bee reported today that Newsome personally issued Stevie Wonder a CDL... permalink FreeFire OP 4 points 8 hours ago https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2025/08/trump-administration-revoke-business-license-employer-who-hired/ permalink RogueLeaderX 4 points 3 hours ago He got his work license in California and ends up killing 3 in Florida. That despicable state keeps killing innocents around the country. permalink CrankyCrab 3 points 6 hours ago One down and many more to go, but is there anything that stops these criminals from incorporating a new business??? You know these crooked fuckers know how to cheat the system and there are too many corrupt government workers who will allow it. permalink FatigueIsReal 3 points 7 hours ago Judge saying he can't do this in 3...2..1... permalink MoreVanceMemes 3 points 8 hours ago Jim Hoft is a pedo permalink phro 3 points 7 hours ago Other states should be able to forbid California CDLs too. Just check them all at the border. permalink InfinitesimalOrange 2 points 7 hours ago This is pretty good, I'd prefer whoever hired the man specifically to be punished, but businesses have effectively muddied culpability to such a degree that no specific individual is ever at fault for the machinations of a company unless they need a patsy. permalink asdrubael_was_right 2 points 3 hours ago People need to go to prison for hiring illegals. If they weren’t hiring these border hopping scumbags they would stop coming. permalink FlyCatcher94 2 points 4 hours ago They will just fire up another company. permalink BoughtByBloomberg2 2 points 3 hours ago Do this to all of them! permalink BrionK 2 points 4 hours ago Do this for all of them Trump. They are killing Americans. permalink terribletwos 1 points 7 hours ago Damn. Do it a few more times to make the point clear. permalink AmericanJawa 1 points 7 hours ago This is the way. permalink Sparks1017 1 points 1 hour ago More of this permalink Bloodclot20 1 points 3 hours ago Now do all of them permalink hillaryforprison 1 points 5 hours ago Why not ALL businesses who hire them. Why continue the charade? Is the country America first for foreigner first, laws or no laws? permalink Txiribiton 1 points 2 hours ago Zzz, they have to fine and arrest all people hiring illegals and they should have done this since day 1. Now you see the consequences of not doing anything, of their total inaction, sorry but they have dedicated more time to talk about amnesty with those criminals. Now a bit of theatre and propaganda through social media, always the same bullshit. permalink Whozat 1 points 60 minutes ago A business license isn't that big of a deal. If you don't obey the law, who cares if you break that law? The whole company is run by illegals. permalink AgnesDomini 1 points 6 hours ago MOAR! This is what we voted for, Pedes! permalink crimsontsunami 1 points 2 hours ago Take PROPERTIES that allow illegals to rent, take businesses that hire anything but 100% pure AMERICAN or LEGAL IMMIGRANTS permalink GainesvilleFlorida 1 points 7 hours ago So yeah this happened here 😠😡😞 permalink PeregrineFalcon 1 points 1 hour ago Now they should go after the owner as an Accessory to negligent homicide. permalink ColonelKlink 1 points 7 hours ago It's about fucking time. permalink Original_Dankster 1 points 11 minutes ago Anecdotally this is good. Systematically this is inadequate. Revoke every license from every business that hires illegals. The President can be magnanimous, and give then 90 days to fire their current illegals and hire citizens. Watch the unemployment rate drop like a hot stone and the economy skyrocket. permalink Groomerboomer 1 points 7 hours ago Can we please stop linking to this weird guys site and link instead to the articles he’s talking about permalink ShyRussian -1 points 7 hours ago RELEASE THE EPS**IN FILES! permalink 1111 CIC Trump puts TEETH into the law >>> Trump Administration REVOKES Business License of Employer Who Hired Illegal Alien Responsible for Killing 3 in Florida Truck Crash (www.thegatewaypundit.com) posted 8 hours ago by FreeFire 105 comments Trump Administration REVOKES Business License of Employer Who Hired Illegal Alien Responsible for Killing 3 in Florida Truck Cra...
