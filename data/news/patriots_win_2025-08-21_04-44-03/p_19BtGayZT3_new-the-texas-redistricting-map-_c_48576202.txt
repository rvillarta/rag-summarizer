It's a balancing act. 38R-0D is mathematically impossible. You'd need to have a much redder state (it was 56 Trump - 42 Kamala in 2024) to do that. permalink War_Hamster 28 points 17 hours ago Speaking of impossible math: -Massachusetts 9 D seats (100%), 0 R seats. Voted 61 -36 for Harris. -Illinois 14 D seats (82%, 3 R Seats. Voted 54-44 for Harris. -California 43 D seats (83%), 9 R seats. Voted 59-38 for Harris. How are they able to make it mathematically possible? permalink view 11 more comments... bill_in_texas 8 points 17 hours ago Texas will bleed some Hispanic voters to the D candidates next go-round. Univision, Telemundo, and the other Spanish language stations are all in on "they're deporting sympathetic illegals, not just the gang bangers. The question is, will that blue wall in the Valley revert back to blue? I think they flipped because the hordes of illegals from everywhere were just too much for them. So they like the fact that the border is now shut down, but they're not going to like the constant barrage of "they're deporting all these good people" stories played non stop on Spanish language media. permalink view 7 more comments... pococurante 4 points 17 hours ago 38R-0D is mathematically impossible.

She won't be able to run for re-election this cycle. I could be wrong, however. Her new district is an existing republican one, albeit with changed borders. permalink CleanUpPhillyTrump24 21 points 18 hours ago Correct. She has to both move or at least buy a property in the new district she calls her primary residence AND run an election that incorporates very centrist, economic Texas Dems so these are not going to be the race-pimping activists on gibs. Centrist Dems in Texas still hold as their core platform 1. jobs 2. it's the economy, stupid and 3. don't raise my taxes. permalink Sparks1017 1 points 16 hours ago Living in the district is not a requirement, just residence in the state permalink Voltage 1 points 13 hours ago That doesn't make sense.

She reflects poorly on the whole country. If she wasn't there anymore the media wouldn't be able to shove her in everyone's face. permalink ModsAreCucked 3 points 15 hours ago Leftist media doesn’t even pay attention to her. It’s all right wing click bait talking about how dumb she is. There’s 500+ congressmen. You haven’t heard of half of them. You are the one making her powerful by caring about her low IQ ragebait permalink Svaap 3 points 17 hours ago The same holds true if we had a fair and non-biased media. Our national media outlets are nothing but Democrat propagandists. Imagine how different it would be if millions of utterly stupid people weren't watching MSNBC or CNN 24/7 and getting ALL their so-called political knowledge exclusively from them. They wouldn't know WHO to vote for without actually gasp doing some research on their own. permalink CleanUpPhillyTrump24 2 points 18 hours ago Kids you want Dems this screamingly terrible to be the face of the party. Art of War. Sun Tzu. Don't interrupt your enemy when they're destroying themselves. Crackpot is a GIFT. permalink BlackPilledMAGA 4 points 18 hours ago No she's not. Every day she survives in government, or AOC, or Illhan Bromar, it only encourages more like them to be installed. I'd much rather see her thrown out than to be tolerated and erode American culture to an even greater degree. permalink Tyscribz 22 points 18 hours ago I'm not in Texas but is Gonzales the one that Brandon Herrera is trying to unseat? permalink Mr_Rightside 15 points 18 hours ago Brandon Herrera is trying to unseat Rino Tony Gonzales from Texas's 23rd Congressional District. Vicente Gonzalez is the Democrat from Texas's 34th Congressional District. permalink Tyscribz 3 points 15 hours ago thanks for clearing that up! :) permalink CleanUpPhillyTrump24 8 points 18 hours ago I think so yes. Pure RINO sell out is Brandon's opposition, I remember that much, who Dominionized himself into office by just 400ish votes. Herrera is as good as in with a clean election. Give him money. I did last time! permalink peterthegreen 4 points 17 hours ago RINO 'Phony Tony' Gonzales only managed to win the GOP runoff because Texas has open primaries which allow Dems to crossover and vote in the GOP primary as long as they don't vote in the Dem primary held that same year. This is why so many RINOs end up being elected in Texas. With the blessing of the Bush-aligned establishment, Dems and media openly urge Dems/Independents to vote in the GOP primary to prevent 'MAGA Republicans' from taking over the Texas GOP. Efforts to pass legislation to close the primaries have failed to gain support in the uniparty-controlled Texas House of Representatives. No leadership from Abbott on this issue either. permalink FromBilgewater 1 points 14 hours ago I'll miss his Gun Meme Review. permalink FiDollaMilkshake 14 points 19 hours ago Gregg Abbott is TRASH. permalink asiandood 11 points 19 hours ago He funds ISLAM, what more do you expect from a pro islamist? permalink irongeek 3 points 17 hours ago he's pro h1b which brought more than 400k Indians in Fort Worth - Dallas area. permalink CleanUpPhillyTrump24 2 points 18 hours ago There is going to be national law on this soon. permalink CleanUpPhillyTrump24 3 points 18 hours ago This is still a win and we can do more redistricting the NEXT session.

Crockett has been whining because her district gets redrawn, not eliminated. It won't be as dominant "D" as it was, putting her re-election in jeopardy. Because she's a lunatic who can only convince ghetto districts with 20% turnout to vote for her because she has a "D" next to her name and a nasty, gutter mouth, her re-election is no longer guaranteed. permalink Trooph-Hurts 9 points 18 hours ago Not enough permalink bigrex64 9 points 19 hours ago bye bye ass hole green!! permalink CleanUpPhillyTrump24 8 points 18 hours ago Green is going to save you ten percent or more on your car insurance. permalink Freedomnuggs 2 points 18 hours ago Captain caveman can finally be put where he belongs, in a museum permalink rextexMG 8 points 18 hours ago Not Crockett?!? permalink CleanUpPhillyTrump24 3 points 18 hours ago Do you want to lose Jazzy the Hoe Faction of the DNC? permalink SomecatsareMAGA 8 points 19 hours ago That’s awesome. permalink Womb___Raider 7 points 18 hours ago Wtf?

She should be gone and her survival is worrying. She wasn't left alone to look bad. permalink TheThreeSeashells 3 points 17 hours ago I believe it's getting redrawn to not be so heavily "D," which puts her re-election in jeopardy. This is why she's been making a big stink. She was one of those do-nothing big mouths who counted on getting elected over and over again because she "represented" a district who had low turnout and voted "D" no matter who it was. Now she has to actually try and win over the same voters she's been insulting. This is weak by the Republicans because it now gives off the impression they caved and it still gives her a chance to keep her seat, but now she is at the very least going to have to be forced to run an actual campaign. permalink Freedomnuggs 1 points 18 hours ago She is an embarrassment to the Dems. permalink bill_in_texas 1 points 16 hours ago She really isn't, though. They love her racist, anti-White rantings. Can't get enough, apparently. permalink BKav 5 points 17 hours ago I’m just pissed they didn’t get rid of Crockett.
