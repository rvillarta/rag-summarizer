If I can do basic math, 150 billion is about 0.25% of 37 trillion. It's a start, sure, but it's barely a start. permalink LolOkFBI 15 points 15 hours ago Reality check? How about you reality check yourself and realize that for the entirety of America's history prior to this, nothing like this has happened, and this is the beginning of a new era.

My electric bill is high too, but I have a room full of computer and server systems running 24/7. permalink iamherefortheluls 2 points 9 hours ago because there have been a bunch of news stories about people finding out their states have sold out their electrical grid to data centers. Corrupt state reps give the companies sweet deals on pricing, defending this as creating jobs or raising tax revenue and than it turns out there are no jobs and the deals include minimal taxation and by the way, the state reps happen to own stocks in these same companies. Here is a youtube covering some of them https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ2tqs_vksc permalink stargunner 1 points 15 hours ago AI needs massive computing power and data farms to be utilized. Those computers and datacenters require massive amounts of cooling, which requires a massive amount of electricity and water. permalink tuaris 1 points 14 hours ago Yeah I know, but what makes you believe that results in your electric bill going up?

Electricity prices will keep rising and the panels are dirt cheap now if you shop around. They never fail either, the only part that an have reliability issues is the inverter. Batteries can be cheap too, although it‚Äôs maybe worth paying more for once with sophisticated software, phone apps etc. Installers are making so much profit. If you can actually do the work yourself or know someone qualified than it‚Äôs a no brainer. Alternatively, find a small local installer who charges an honest price. If you don‚Äôt believe me than just search for the prices of the panels themselves. Unless they‚Äôve been impacted by tariffs they‚Äôll still be a bargain price permalink view 3 more comments... yurimodin 0 points 12 hours ago ‚òùÔ∏è permalink bidensmissingbrain 11 points 15 hours ago My clients expecting a 15-25% reduction in revenue in the upcoming fiscal year speaks a hell of lot louder to me about the state of the economy than some billion-level number sitting in the government piggy bank to be swiped by whatever bureaucrat. permalink movetofirefox 3 points 15 hours ago I work in a manufacturing business, I can tell you everyone is very tariff-conscious and a ton of manufacturing work in our supply chain is moving back to the USA. permalink conservativefrank 3 points 13 hours ago The average American is seeing higher prices.

A bunch of performative crap meant to satiate the dumb sheep with their cheer leading outfits on. permalink GA_Logic -5 points 15 hours ago USA making money from tariffs isn't performative at all that is real and tangible. permalink MemphisMontoya71 2 points 12 hours ago Its a rounding error, if you can do math, not hopium. permalink EvilGuy 2 points 9 hours ago Again we do not make money from tariffs. Or rather we do not collect money from other countries with tariffs. Lets give you an example: I am a China seller. You buy something from me that you need and no one else sells, I ship it to you, the US government charges you a percentage for not buying American when it clears customs. You pay the tax. No one in China is paying anything. The only reason countries hate tariffs is because it makes people buy less of their stuff by making it more expensive. If the US government charges a 100% tariff on that countries cars, you probably will decide to buy an American car instead. So again this is all paid by the consumer at the end of the day. I am not sure why people have such a hard time grasping how tariffs work. They are not a free money glitch that is going to pay off our debt. permalink GA_Logic -1 points 4 hours ago That is incorrect. Tarrifs are paid by other countries to do business with the US. If that cost is passed onto the customer that may or may not happen. But you all are presuming it is 100% certainty which is why you all can't admit you are wrong. permalink EvilGuy 1 points 3 hours ago How are tariffs paid in your looneytoons world? Do you think the US is billing China for stuff? What actually happens is it gets tacked on when it goes through customs. You buy something for 1000 dollars from China you get a bill for 300 bucks for the tariff that you have to pay before you will get your item. Seriously ill informed people like yourself are why politicians are the way they are. You think they should respect you when a 13 year old in middle school knows more about how this stuff works than you do? Do better. Read a book. permalink Carbum 7 points 15 hours ago I bet it all goes to Israel permalink GA_Logic -3 points 15 hours ago Israel is paying tariffs too as far as I know. permalink EvilGuy 2 points 9 hours ago This makes me think you do not understand tariffs. It's okay our school system and media are shit. If you buy something from Israel YOU might have to pay an additional tax on it but Israel isn't paying a damn thing. Tariffs are an incentive on YOU to buy American to avoid paying it. This $150 Billion is just a tax on Americans and American companies for buying foreign goods. Other countries don't like tariffs because it makes their stuff more expensive so they sell less of it. Not because they have to pay some fee to America. permalink GA_Logic 0 points 4 hours ago That is incorrect. Tariffs are an incentive to have things made in America by foreign countries as well as domestic. permalink EvilGuy 1 points 3 hours ago Go read a book or something. I gave you an exact definition and example of how a tariff works. You saying no it doesn't just makes you look stupid. Sorry not trying to be mean here but literally 5 minutes of research would show you that I am right and yet you posted like 10 times in this thread about something you cannot be bothered to actually learn something about.

That's merely symbolic. It's literally not even a drop in the bucket when you need to somehow make up for 2.5 trillion in overspending every year. There is NO MATHEMATICAL WAY to fix this problem without cutting spending on social welfare and entitlement programs. Do you doubt it? Consider this. The government has 4.5 trillion in revenue for the year. This is a high level breakdown of what we currently spend: 1.2 trillion for Social Security 1.2 trillion for Medicare 1.2 trillion for welfare 700 billion for Medicaid 800 billion for defense 1.3 trillion on the interest payment on the national debt 300 billion misc like infrastructure, foreign aid etc So you tell me how we eliminate 2.5 trillion in spending without dramatically cutting gibsmedat programs when they alone eat up the entirety of what we have for revenue before a dime is spent on anything else? We're spending 6% of the entire global GDP on social welfare programs. That's INSANE. We desperately need the GOP to come around on this topic. This socialist bullshit is destroying our economy and the currency. permalink Hawk_tuah 1 points 1 hour ago The reality is we still need places like China and others because they have the labor force, infrastructure, and scale to produce thousands of products America currently has no equal for. Rebuilding that kind of capacity here would take decades and cost many times more, which would crush small businesses and price regular people out of the market. Tariffs alone don‚Äôt make us competitive overnight they just make everything more expensive while we wait for factories that don‚Äôt exist yet. Until we rebuild our own base, China remains our factory floor. permalink CMDRConanAAnderson 1 points 16 hours ago I really hope the intention of tariffs isn't to negotiate, rather isolate. If we cut deals with people we hate and that hate us, it defeats the purpose. If people want to get fucked over and still hate us that's fine, but if we cut a deal just so there's some kind of deal it's really just a type of negotiable tax. I want fucking embargoes is what I expected out this all. permalink RockFlagAndEagle2020 1 points 16 hours ago We could cut our deficit so much faster if we just wait for it cut government spending. permalink GA_Logic 1 points 15 hours ago A very good starting point. permalink G-209 1 points 11 hours ago Looks like any messages slightly criticizing President Trump or his admin gets deleted . permalink ShitAss 1 points 14 hours ago Who gives a shit? permalink Dev404 1 points 15 hours ago Good, next on the list should be to investigate and imprison the MFers in Congress that put us into this debt to begin with.

It makes me laugh when I here or see people talking that the glass is half or less full. Trump or for that matter anyone in that office is not going to change that many years of corruption in 4 years. They need to do what they can in the limited amount if time they have. Then throw in the stalling and stupid judges and comfimation picks that have not happened yet, all slows it down. If you're looking for ovenight trasitions out of this crap, well, it just is not going to happen. All in good time my pretty. permalink GA_Logic -1 points 15 hours ago A lot of anxiety over seeing instant results but I remember that it took the 2nd year of Presdient Trumps first term to start to see the economic engine take off. I believe a repeat of that will occur in 2026 early on. Especially true when the new Fed chair cuts rates. permalink imminent_ban -3 points 16 hours ago Exporters lowered prices so that importers could absorb the tariff and not raise prices on the consumer.

Exporters lowered a little, but not close to the 30-50% tariffs being charged in most cases. Prices are going up, Trump's other economic policies are helping to counteract some of the increases but overall this isn't the big win we think it is. If we were a lower cost country these blanket tariffs would work out better, but we are a high cost country. For the most part this is just another big tax on the American people. Trump has good intentions here, but this is not going to end well unless he moderates on the super high tariffs. permalink yougotfooledlmao 1 points 15 hours ago Comment removed by community filter, pending further review. permalink Lionheart509 1 points 15 hours ago Comment removed by community filter, pending further review. permalink 37dwarves 1 points 5 hours ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink 1223 $150 BILLION IN TARIFFS COLLECTED.
