129 You abused your security clearance by bad mouthing the President while having your clearance. You have been badmouthing him for years. Now you don’t have a clearance. You signed the 2019 letter. Everything I said is accurate. Enjoy losing your Kentucky Senate race too, loser. posted 3 hours ago by PiratePatriotParrot PRO 7 comments Laura Loomer @LauraLoomer • 10h You abused your security clearance by bad mouthing the President while having your clearance.

Joel Willett @realJoelWillett • 10h Fact Check: I didn't have a security clearance in 2019. You can't "abuse" something you don't have. One hell of a scoop, Laura. 7 comments Belleoffreedom 1 points 2 hours ago So, who's lying here? It's hard to tell. permalink Tookens 3 points 2 hours ago "That depends on what the meaning of 'is' is." permalink PatPede1 2 points 2 hours ago Both? That seems to be the most likely answer in political circles. permalink SqRt7744 1 points 13 minutes ago Probably both to a greater or lesser degree. I don't know or care about Willett, but I know Loomer is a liar. permalink BarrysOFace 1 points 9 minutes ago Pretty sure having a clearance doesn't prevent you from badmouthing the president. permalink SqRt7744 0 points 13 minutes ago Loomer is a worthless israel firster. Her latest big success was sucessfully getting her controlled puppet Rubio to deny special medical treatment visas for Palestinian kids with serious injuries / medical conditions that can't be treated in razed gaza. Yay!? Gtfooh you psycho bitch. permalink SanityGumby 1 points 52 seconds ago Go back to India faggot permalink 129 You abused your security clearance by bad mouthing the President while having your clearance.
