By the time they were Juniors it had morphed into the Gay Students Association. Talk about mission creep...or denouement permalink Bldg_2019 7 points 22 minutes ago Might I suggest a little Canadian health care? You know, just a consultation to see the options. permalink BillGateCanSuckIt 5 points 22 minutes ago Quit and then join the 43% club permalink Modernturnkey 5 points 21 minutes ago "I NEED EVERYONE TO KNOW WHO I HAVE SEX WITH" permalink Caliban 5 points 20 minutes ago Thanks, i needed a 'feel-good' story this morning. permalink eddieblasphemy 5 points 20 minutes ago safe space stickers work just like gun free zone sigs. permalink suitwo_wtr 5 points 18 minutes ago Good, bully the groomers out of school. They show more loyalty to that than the US flag and constitution, both of which they made it their mission to remove. They should be nowhere near children. permalink XlDEN 4 points 19 minutes ago I can only imagine how Reddit responded. permalink HoganP OP 4 points 1 hour ago https://x.com/reddit_lies/status/1958301883367338376 Now I'll have that song stuck in my head all day, but this is cool. permalink DingleBalls 4 points 1 hour ago No safe spaces.

Fuck this Marxist shit!! permalink Beer-_-Belly 2 points 13 minutes ago She should quit. We need teachers not indoctrination specialists. permalink hazelknut 2 points 13 minutes ago it's amazing what the little tykes will say when they no longer fear retribution from groomers. permalink Antenna 1 points 6 minutes ago I shudder to ask: what is a GSA advisor? permalink WarEagleMAGA 1 points 2 minutes ago Grooming Service of America permalink TimoSalami 1 points 3 minutes ago I hope the L’s and the G’s understand this is the fault of the B’s T’s Q’s and +’s permalink 169 The kids are alright posted 1 hour ago by HoganP 19 comments
