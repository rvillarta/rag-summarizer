There were checkpoints too. permalink Belleoffreedom OP 5 points 2 hours ago https://x.com/ImMeme0/status/1958308398987886684 permalink _Sully_ 3 points 47 minutes ago This reminded me. I took an Uber like 3 months ago with a younger adult black woman as a driver. And I swear she couldn't help but talk to me about shit. I guess I have that look now lol. The entire ride she gushed about Trump and how she was so sick of the status quo in Portland. She would ask me guarded questions and I would just answer straight and based as usual. It was hilarious because it made her giggle and relieved. The entire ride she was nodding her head and saying "Yeah, right?!" I said we've all been tormented for years and it's about time we say what's on our minds without fear of being attacked. It was super refreshing. permalink FatBeagleMars 2 points 59 minutes ago Enjoy the beauty of your city. God Bless. permalink Mulletgunning 2 points 45 minutes ago Good for them. Release the Epstein files from all Intel agencies and we will show you what happens libtard.MAGA AF permalink hazelknut 1 points 27 minutes ago fucking MSM will never let the country know this is how the residents feel cus orange man bad. permalink bangbus 1 points 58 minutes ago When I lived in Chicago my secretary was an older black lady who lived on the west side, which as a neighborhood has got to be pound for pound as dangerous as anything in fucking Brazil. If you got her going she had a law and order streak that would have made Mao or Stalin blush. She wanted an absolute boot jammed up the ass of the 12-24 year olds who were the source of 99% of the crime. But if you asked her about politics, Obama was the greatest human being to ever live and it was unthinkable to vote anything other than D. Oh, and her second biggest political issue was abortion, adamantly opposed. I told her she was actually a conservative and it damned near melted her brain. The level of propaganda and conditioning that has been laid upon the people has been so immense that there is an existential battle for us to stop it. This video is obviously just one woman, but I find it highly encouraging. The Dems absolutely cannot allow Trump to try to quell crime in major cities because if he is successful they will lose the entire hoodrat voting bloc. Absolutely disgusting behavior from the “country over party” assholes. I hope the legacy DNC is broken into a million pieces. permalink SBOJ_JOBS 1 points 13 minutes ago DOUBLETHINK -1984 Doublethink is a process of indoctrination in which subjects are expected to simultaneously accept two conflicting beliefs as truth, often at odds with their own memory or sense of reality. permalink BattleOfSaratoga 1 points 49 minutes ago Daughter of NOT TOOODAAY grown up? permalink YodaBannon 1 points 45 minutes ago Hopefully it gets extended. permalink Dr_Eggman 1 points 2 hours ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink 293 Union Station is different posted 2 hours ago by Belleoffreedom 18 comments I Meme Therefore I Am 🇺🇸 @ImMeme0 • 12h DC woman raves about how much safer and cleaner Union Station has become after President Trump deployed the National Guard.🔥🔥🔥 “Thumbs up, Trump!”
