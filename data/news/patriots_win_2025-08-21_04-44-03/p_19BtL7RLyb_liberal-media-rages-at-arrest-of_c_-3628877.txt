Hasta la vista baby!! permalink Filo76 19 points 8 hours ago Amazing how consistently wrong the media is about these diverse, cultural enrichers. permalink crimsonfancy 9 points 7 hours ago They try to capitalize on events and get ahead of the truth. They know right and wrong but do not care whatsoever. Theyre mistaken on purpose and hope to be the first to signal virtue and create buzz before the truth emerges. If there were accountability for fake news, might could change. On the contrary, they see rewards. permalink CleanUpPhillyTrump24 11 points 8 hours ago Why was a child rapist driving around the National Mall, which is where thousands of school children visit? permalink Zskills 10 points 8 hours ago Why is any child rapist still breathing? permalink Get_Off_Big_Tech 2 points 7 hours ago I think you just answered your own question. permalink HoganT 8 points 8 hours ago Why was he not convicted and in jail? permalink PapaPepe 11 points 8 hours ago You spelled woodchipper wrong. permalink HoganT -1 points 8 hours ago If we don‚Äôt even have enough evidence to keep prosecutors from dropping charges as grievous as that, we don‚Äôt really have grounds for extrajudicial murder in a cruel and unusual fashion. permalink Hanging_Chad 0 points 8 hours ago anal rape by a tranny, until the brink of death. then firing squad? permalink HoganT 2 points 8 hours ago How about we actually legally charge, prove, and convict people of crimes before embracing cruel and unusual punishments. permalink view 2 more comments... mass55th 3 points 8 hours ago One post said via a search said that those charges had been dropped, but that unverified. There is an active final order of removal on him after coming here illegally three times. permalink HoganT -1 points 8 hours ago but that unverified Well he wasn‚Äôt convicted and in prison, so it‚Äôs pretty clearly verified. There is an active final order of removal on him after coming here illegally three times. No argument there. Deport him. But don‚Äôt claim someone is ‚Äúwanted for child sexual assault‚Äù when they‚Äôre not, just because we feel we‚Äôre arguing from a weak position with bad optics. permalink deleted -1 points 8 hours ago HoganT 1 points 8 hours ago He was, isn‚Äôt a contraction, fren. permalink view 1 more comments...

(Maybe have a stiff poster-board attached to a strong magnet so it can be attached to the top of their vehicles) "Jose Ramirez - Convicted of raping and murdering a 7 year old girl. He is currently roaming in your neighborhood. ICE is here to arrest this murderer." Etc. So when all of these stupid protesters start calling ICE Nazis and fascists...and scream, "Why are you kid-napping brown people?" ..etc. They will look very foolish when everyone's videoing these arrest and these idiots are protesting the arrest of child rapist/murders. Basically show everyone how evil and monstrous these paid protesters are. permalink InfinitesimalOrange 2 points 7 hours ago At this point I can't even devils advocate anyone still in the democrat party, you're either completely braindead or 150 year old social security recipient. permalink Snek_Plissken 1 points 7 hours ago I had someone today saying the crazy leftists were the far leftists and not the norm. You, now you have ‚Äúfar‚Äù leftists. There is no distinction in the votes on the left.

Every single time, they jump the gun in defense of really bad people. Is their hate for Trump that bad, or are they just that naive/stupid? permalink HillaryRodhamCunton 2 points 7 hours ago Countless pedophile illegals in Wyandotte county, KS jail.
