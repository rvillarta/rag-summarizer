I.E. putting commies in our government by voting illegally permalink IroWide 32 points 15 hours ago That's just the cherry on top. I'm sick of the trash they throw around, Im sick of the ugly paint colors they ruin homes with, the stupid carnival music they blast all the time, the fart can honda civics, the new businesses that are entirely spanish, and the crime. They set up little Mexicos everywhere they settle.

Now our young people can't afford to live good, comfortable middle-class lives. It's total bullshit, completely and ridiculously out of control. I definitely voted for SO many of these deportations. permalink BigGunky 0 points 13 hours ago the crime and businesses run entirely in spanish are reason enough to get the illegals out... but getting your panties wadded over someone else's preferences in paint, music, and cars is pretty gay. Then again, the House Paint Purge of 2028 has a fun ring to it. Could be our night of the long knives.

Get the fuck out of our country, I'm sick and tried of hitting ONE for English permalink BidensPrisonWallet 32 points 17 hours ago These LEOs need some more training. Who doesn't know that mezkins are similar to cue-balls? The harder you hit them the more English you get out of them. permalink edxzxz 19 points 17 hours ago I worked for a rent-a-center as a repo man and of all the hilarious interactions I had doing that job, my favorite was a spanish speaking family was having their washer and dryer repossessed, none of them spoke English, until I cut the water hose while the washing machine was running and started putting it on the hand truck, then suddenly they spoke English! I still wheeled their shit out to the truck. permalink mty_green_go 13 points 16 hours ago lol you activated the translator.

But the reason is he's aqu√≠ ilegalmente. So if you see ICE working and the crowd insists there's no "warrant" (there doesn't need to be with ICE) or he "did nothing wrong," say AQUI ILEGALMENTE HOMBRE. They'll tranqui', baby. permalink view 2 more comments... TentacleLord 1 points 10 hours ago You forgot "daddy". I swear he says "papi" while on the ground permalink view 1 more comments...
