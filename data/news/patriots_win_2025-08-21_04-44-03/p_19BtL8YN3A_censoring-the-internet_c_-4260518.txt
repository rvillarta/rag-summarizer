Either something 27 comments ReleasetheList 10 points 32 minutes ago Could be or could just be the fact that the people that seek power are often tyrants that should be the furthest from power because the reason they want it is to enact control over people, without really needing an excuse or reason to do so. permalink westrock2000 7 points 26 minutes ago America stopped being in control of the internet. The internet was born in America, because America was the only place citizens didn’t even consider that they couldn’t say any random shit anonymously. It never crossed their minds, unlike in every other country. permalink EatingDarkness 1 points 20 minutes ago Invented by an English man in fairness but yes born in America. It's time to find local like minded people... In a few years it will be impossible to distinguish truth from fiction. permalink BugsleyKAG 3 points 10 minutes ago Al Gore invented the Internet. permalink anotherthing 2 points 6 minutes ago The only Englishman involved was Daniel Davies, who was Welsh. Everyone else was American. permalink permissible_missile 2 points 14 minutes ago Invented by an English man You mean the Web, right? Do you even know? You dudes know that it's okay to be quiet about things you are clueless about, correct? permalink Meister_Bockmist 4 points 13 minutes ago Al Gore is English? permalink permissible_missile 1 points 10 minutes ago Al Gore had nothing to do with the Web. He was instrumental in (believe it or not) deregulating the Internet. I repeat: not speaking is always an option. permalink view 2 more comments... Whoopies_tds 1 points 8 minutes ago Uhhh nice try bigot, it was invented in Africa by Shaniqua Wafflehutcerf permalink permissible_missile -1 points 15 minutes ago America stopped being in control of the internet. This narrative is laughed at by people who have a clue. You're referring to ICANN, right? Do you even know? Pop quiz: what does the "inter" in internet mean? Go ahead, this time farm out the need to think to an AI. permalink EdgyUsernamexX69Xx 4 points 23 minutes ago The internet is already heavily censored, idk where the rest of you have been permalink MEME-SUPREME 2 points 21 minutes ago The next level of AI is widely seen as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), AI with human-like reasoning and problem-solving skills across diverse domains, followed by Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), which would surpass human intellect exponentially. Shorter-term advancements include multimodal AI, which processes various data types like images and text, and hyper-intelligent systems that integrate multiple AI forms and leverage advanced hardware like quantum computing. Longer-Term Concepts Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): . This is the conceptual goal of creating AI with the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge to a wide range of tasks, similar to a human being. Artificial Superintelligence (ASI): . The hypothetical level beyond AGI, where AI would become self-improving and significantly smarter than the most intelligent humans, leading to rapid technological advancement and problem-solving beyond human comprehension. Near-Term Advancements Multimodal Models: . These AI systems can process and understand multiple types of data, such as text, images, audio, and video, in a more integrated and human-like manner. Hyper-Intelligent Systems: . These systems are characterized by higher-order cognitive abilities, including reasoning, planning, and creativity. Quantum Computing & Neuromorphic Hardware: . Emerging technologies like quantum computing and neuromorphic hardware are expected to provide the computational power and efficiency needed for next-generation AI to solve previously unsolvable problems. Unsupervised & Reinforcement Learning: . AI is becoming more capable of learning without human-provided labels (unsupervised learning) and learning through trial and error (reinforcement learning). Integration of Existing AI Technologies: . The next phase will involve combining different AI forms, like generative AI, in a "One-AI" approach to create more comprehensive and complementary capabilities. permalink TakingAction 1 points 19 minutes ago TLDR? permalink permissible_missile 0 points 13 minutes ago Tl;dr if you can't read that much text, AI is already smarter than you. Learn the intricacies of ditch digging. permalink 181degrees 2 points 20 minutes ago Start with censoring kids because fewer adults will complain. Once the ID technology is fully in place, they'll start rolling it out for adults under a different reason. permalink KeepingAmericaGreat 2 points 17 minutes ago Inoculation against MAGA, they're concerned about its spread. permalink A_Colostomy_Bag 2 points 15 minutes ago Ok got a vpn, check. Next step, get on decentralized..... huh? Is he talking about a tor browser? I think ultimately there's gonna be a "dark web" for average people who just want the internet to be like it used to. In many ways the internet was better in the early 2000's. permalink Lowersidecustoms 2 points 14 minutes ago Too much noticing going on. I don't think it's mere coincidence that the favorability of Israel has been tanking in recent months and more internet censorship is a priority. permalink TheImpossible1 0 points 10 minutes ago Except the censorship hasn't been of pro-Pallie retards, it's overwhelmingly been of anti-female, anti-natalist speech and behaviors. The elite need more kids to rape. permalink hughjasske69 1 points 5 minutes ago Facebook now requires you to upload a photo of your ID and provide video selfies for verification before creating an account. permalink MathletesFoot 1 points 2 minutes ago The worrying thing is that even countries like Russia are in on it. permalink UltraMAGAMilton 1 points 2 seconds ago They just found their foot in the door with people accepting certain tyrannical regulations and privacy violations on the internet under the guise of protecting kids. I called this and was accused of want kids to see xxx videos. Tyranny always expands itself and now that you guys let the Vampire inside, its going g to have its way with you . .. permalink redredwine 1 points 20 minutes ago Plot-twist - we all already know it was a hoax. permalink Antenna 1 points 9 minutes ago Just as he gets to the part you really need to know it cuts off. permalink TheImpossible1 -1 points 17 minutes ago More Babies, Less Gaming Emmanuel Macron, Davos 2024.
