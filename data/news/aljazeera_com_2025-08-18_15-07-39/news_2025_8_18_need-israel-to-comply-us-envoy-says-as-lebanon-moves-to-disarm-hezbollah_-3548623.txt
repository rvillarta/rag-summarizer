They’ve taken the first step. Now what we need is Israel to comply with that equal handshake,” Barrack told reporters on Monday, in Lebanon’s capital of Beirut, after meeting Lebanese President Joseph Aoun.Recommended Stories list of 4 itemslist 1 of 4Will Lebanon succeed in disarming Hezbollah?list 2 of 4Hezbollah says Lebanon disarmament plan serves Israel, vows to keep weaponslist 3 of 4Lebanon, Iran’s delicate diplomacy amid calls to disarm Hezbollahlist 4 of 4Lebanon rejects foreign interference, president tells Iran officialend of listThe US-backed plan sets out a four-phase roadmap for the Hezbollah group to hand in their arsenal as Israel’s military halts ground, air and sea operations and withdraws troops from Lebanon’s south.Lebanon’s cabinet approved the plan on August 7 despite Hezbollah’s outright refusal to disarm, raising fears that Israel could intensify attacks on Lebanon, even while it carries out near-daily violations of the November truce it signed with Hezbollah to end its war.Israel has continued these attacks against Lebanon even in the weeks since the cabinet approved the plan.Barrack described the cabinet’s decision as a “Lebanese decision that requires Israel’s cooperation” and said the US was “in the process of now discussing with Israel what their position is” but provided no further details.Asked by reporters about whether he expected to see Israel fully withdraw from Lebanese territory, the US envoy said “that’s exactly the next step” needed.“There is cooperation from all sides. We are not here to intimidate anyone. The positive outcomes will benefit Hezbollah, Lebanon, and Israel alike,” he said.US Special Envoy Tom Barrack listens to a question during a joint news conference following his meeting with Lebanon’s president at the Presidential Palace in Baabda on August 18, 2025 [AFP]‘Israelis don’t listen to what the Americans have to say’Hezbollah will insist on not agreeing to hand over its arms unless Israel stops launching attacks and withdraws from occupied Lebanese territories, Ali Rizk, a security affairs analyst, told Al Jazeera from Beirut.

That means how to merge Hezbollah’s weapons into the state,” Rizk said.Sign up for Al JazeeraAmericas Coverage Newsletterprotected by reCAPTCHAHe said the bigger obstacle to realising Barrack’s vision is Israel, and that is evident in the latest visit by Israeli army chief Eyal Zamir to occupied Lebanese territory and statements by far-right Israeli ministers who say they intend to stay in Lebanon.“Ever since October 7, we’ve become accustomed to the fact that the Israelis don’t listen to what the Americans have to say, even when the Americans somewhat escalate their tone.”Rizk said he would be surprised if the Israeli army withdraws from the five points it occupies in Lebanon, even after the Lebanese government publicly committed to disarming Hezbollah by the end of the year.‘An economic proposal’The US envoy also said Washington would seek an economic proposal for post-war reconstruction in the country, after months of shuttle diplomacy between the US and Lebanon.Barrack voiced optimism after Monday’s meeting, stating: “A return to prosperity and peace is within reach. I believe we will witness progress in several areas in the coming weeks.”“This is the first visit of the American envoy to Lebanon after the Lebanese cabinet mandated the Lebanese army to assess how to disarm Hezbollah,” said Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem, reporting from Beirut.“However, there are a lot of concerns with respect to how this process is going to happen, given the fact that Hezbollah refused.”On Friday, Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem raised the spectre of civil war, warning there would be “no life” in Lebanon should the state attempt to confront or eliminate the group.In a written statement after his meeting with Barrack, Aoun said “other parties” now needed to commit to the roadmap’s contents.Barrack is also set to meet with Prime Minister Nawaf Salam and Speaker Nabih Berri, who often negotiates on behalf of Hezbollah with Washington.
A ‘return to prosperity and peace’?Under phase one of the US-backed plan, the Lebanese government is to issue a decision committing to Hezbollah’s full disarmament by the end of the year – which it now has – and Israel will cease military operations in Lebanese territory.In phase two, Lebanon would begin implementing the disarmament plan within 60 days, and the government would approve troop deployments to the south. Then, Israel would begin withdrawing from the south and releasing Lebanese prisoners. Advertisement In phase three, which should happen within 90 days of that, Israel is to withdraw from the last two of the five disputed border positions, and money would be secured for Lebanon’s reconstruction.In phase four, Hezbollah’s remaining heavy weapons are to be dismantled, and Lebanon’s allies will organise a conference to support the country’s economic recovery.Hezbollah emerged badly weakened from last year’s 14-month war with Israel, during which longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah was assassinated in a huge Israeli strike on Beirut. Before the war, Hezbollah was believed to be better armed than the Lebanese military.The group has long maintained it needs to keep its arsenal to defend Lebanon from attacks, but critics accused it of using its weapons for political leverage.Hezbollah has said it refuses to discuss its arsenal until Israel ends its attacks and withdraws troops from southern Lebanon. Aoun and Salam both want to disarm Hezbollah and have also demanded Israel halt its attacks and withdraw from the country.Just on Monday, Israeli attacks blew up a house in the town of Meiss el-Jabal, a sound bomb went off in the border town of Dahra, and drones could be overheard in the towns of Wadi Zefta, al-Numairiyeh and Wadi Kafra, Lebanon’s National News Agency reported.Aoun said he wants to increase funding for Lebanon’s military and raise money from international donors for post-war reconstruction. The World Bank estimates that the war caused $11bn in damage and economic losses. The country has also faced a crippling economic crisis since 2019.
