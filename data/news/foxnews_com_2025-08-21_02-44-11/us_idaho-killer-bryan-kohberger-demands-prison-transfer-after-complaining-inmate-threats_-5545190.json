    "article_summary": "Bryan Kohberger, convicted for the murder of four University of Idaho students, is requesting a transfer from his current prison wing due to threats and harassment from other inmates. He has submitted a handwritten complaint to prison officials, citing \"minute-by-minute verbal threats/harassment\" and a desire to be moved to a quieter wing called B Block. Experts warn that Kohberger may be a bigger target due to his \"weird\" behavior and social awkwardness, similar to Jeffrey Dahmer.</s>"
