Oh and throw a bunch of people in prison. permalink Reefay 3 points 8 hours ago Gallows would be cheaper permalink vegaspatriot1776 2 points 3 hours ago The cartels have control of AZ. Kinetic action is the only option at this point. permalink greatpumpkin 25 points 16 hours ago Cheating's the only way hobbs could 'win'. Just like ranked choice 'voting' did for mercowski ..... permalink lixa 4 points 9 hours ago Katie Cartel Hobbs. There's a dull axe with her name on it after she loses her trial. permalink RedCapNation 20 points 14 hours ago The current gov in Arizona is guilty of treason and should be arrested, tried and hanged in public. permalink CCGJoe 3 points 13 hours ago Yes.

Nada permalink ChyNahAzzWhole1 7 points 15 hours ago And... vote DEMOCRAT 100% permalink TheThreeSeashells 7 points 15 hours ago Glad to see something finally being done about the people who were behind the fraud and those who benefitted from it. Oh, wait... permalink HeavyMetalPatriot 6 points 15 hours ago AND...what is being done? Why is Hobgoblin still in office??? permalink Koikatrose 6 points 13 hours ago Arizona so corrupt it wreaks....I was kicked off registration role to "verify" my birth certificate. So since mine is seriously packed away I have to send off to the county I was born in to get a new copy. That could take how long???? Meanwhile my grandfather received a scanable registration card in the mail here at my address. No verification, just QR code scan. Trouble is...my grandfather never lived at this address....in fact my grandfather died in 1982!!! So he can register and get a ballot easier than I can? BTW I have been an outspoken republican voter since 1972! permalink lixa 2 points 8 hours ago Reeks. Wreak is for havoc. Good (terrible) story though that's ridiculous but not surprising! permalink raptormissle 6 points 14 hours ago Joe Shit Stain Biden has always been an illegitimate piece of shit resident. permalink lixa 2 points 8 hours ago The only time I pretend he was legitimate is is when I'm berating liberals for how the democrat party overthrew his incumbent candidacy for someone who never won a primary and didn't get a single vote when they destroyed democracy to put her on the ticket for President. permalink Hodeefuk123 3 points 14 hours ago I know her and worked along side her. I am so excited she is continuing the fight against corruption. permalink MythArcana 2 points 14 hours ago Ban the DNC to ensure this never happens again. permalink PoleWatcher 1 points 2 hours ago Need to get humans out. Have an atm type machine place your thumb on the sensor look at the camera login then vote. Pretty simple permalink FlyCatcher94 1 points 11 hours ago Oopsies. We will catch it next time. Pinky swear permalink Counterwhat 1 points 2 hours ago That's why Fox called Arizona for the demento patient. After that I never watched another spoken word from Fox. Corruption is corruption and when you see it you know. permalink BobDolesBanana 1 points 9 hours ago Absentee ballots were used extensively through out the US during the 2020 General Election for President of the United States. Although there were many claims of illegal activities with the use of absentee ballots and three states (Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin) had a margin of victory under 1%, there was only one case (Ward v. Jackson) where forensic handwriting analysts were enlisted by plaintiffs and defendants in the evaluation of signatures for absentee ballots used in 2020. In that case, only 100 absentee ballot envelopes had their signatures evaluated despite the margin of victory in the state (Arizona) being a tight 0.3%. Of those 100 ballots, the analysts found 6-11% of the signatures were inconclusive, primarily due to the lack of enough signature on file. Regardless, the court accepted the inclusive signatures as valid for reasons (phone number of voter was present on envelope and the ballot was mailed to voter's address) that many have criticized as insufficient to meet security required for the use of absentee ballots. permalink lixa 1 points 8 hours ago Were these actual absentee or blanket mail in? They're different. permalink patriotplus 1 points 13 hours ago calm down......Bondi is all over it.......never mind permalink Thops 0 points 13 hours ago So when the fuk is someone going to get arrested?
