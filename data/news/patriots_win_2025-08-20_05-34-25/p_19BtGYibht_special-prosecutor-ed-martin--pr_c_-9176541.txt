Please prove me wrong! permalink Nellie_the_Beaut 3 points 9 hours ago LOL, NYC is getting ready to put a foreign born, radical socialist in as the Mayor of NYC! Think any of this “elected” cabal fears consequences for their illegal and unethical activities? They are so emboldened. Also, this witch is just dragging things out in hopes that her pals in DC come through and force Trump out of office and the case against her will be dropped. If she is somehow found guilty and removed from office, the “voters” of NY will just put somebody else in her place just as awful, or worse. Or maybe chipmunk Hochul gets to replace her? I’m sure she will choose a competent , deserving, and impartial black, Asian or Hispanic gay woman for the role. permalink Aggrieved03 2 points 11 hours ago The walls are closing in! permalink SubmarineGuy 2 points 5 hours ago Paybacks are a BITCH! permalink The_Highlander 2 points 8 hours ago Whatever permalink I-am-Orlando OP PRO 2 points 13 hours ago Link https://x.com/nicksortor/status/1957950731467780442 permalink 623 Special Prosecutor Ed Martin privately called on NY AG Letitia James to RESIGN amid the criminal investigation into her for mortgage fraud.
