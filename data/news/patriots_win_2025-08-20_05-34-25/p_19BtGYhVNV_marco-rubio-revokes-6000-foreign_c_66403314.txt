1479 Marco Rubio revokes 6,000 foreign visas. (www.cbsnews.com) posted 16 hours ago by JTIM 81 comments State Department revokes over 6,000 student visas, citing law breaking and overstays More than a million foreign students study in the U.S. each year. www.cbsnews.com 81 comments BasedJaffa 87 points 16 hours ago This needs to be more like 600,000 permalink airborne3502 45 points 16 hours ago Especially since the first line of the article is "more than a million foreign students study in the US each year." permalink CleanUpPhillyTrump24 12 points 16 hours ago The criteria included social media without any support of Hamas or other known, listed US recognized terror groups, so a smaller list than the UAE or Saudi Arabia even. That means there were some bad hombres in there who were up to no good, likely just using "study" as a front for intel operations by hostile foreign entities. IOW we got rid of a thick slate of sleeper cells, not just highway blockers. permalink they-see-me-trollin PRO 4 points 11 hours ago so we need a million visa revocations. i voted for this. permalink Formerlurker92 16 points 16 hours ago Cut off the money spigot to the corrupt anti american colleges by denying them their foreign students permalink ninabobby 15 points 16 hours ago It would be if they went beyond ‚Äúpeople who don‚Äôt love Israel more than life itself‚Äù permalink dogofwar 1 points 15 hours ago Quite the opposite. If that's what they were doing, they'd have already revoked millions of visas. Nobody likes Israel on either side. permalink Illuminaughty 3 points 15 hours ago Yeah but most people are too afraid or too indifferent to say anything about it permalink DebunkTheLeft 10 points 16 hours ago More like 6,000,000 permalink joggin_noggin 5 points 12 hours ago Oy vey permalink MakeAdulteryKillable 2 points 15 hours ago Its time get rid of ALL legal immigrants for our own American ‚ÄúGreat Reset.‚Äù permalink Formerlurker92 24 points 16 hours ago This is a nice start Keep going permalink airborne3502 8 points 16 hours ago I like your optimism.

Hes trying to erase what he did 2016-2024. permalink maverick202 7 points 14 hours ago 0 chance at being president in 28. But he'll be a badass VP to Vance. He's looking good for 36 run though. permalink invalid_data 2 points 12 hours ago Rubio should never be president material. Hes lived in the swamp too long, is a lawyer, and doesnt connect to real Americans. permalink Tiredofstupidpeople 1 points 5 hours ago Letting your guard down on Rubio is a mistake imo. I find it hard to believe after his past that he suddenly had a come to Jesus moment and turned full Maga, despite the fact he's been saying and even doing some good things. We don't know what's going on behind the scenes. I'm keeping my eye on him. permalink PeaceMakerDJT 11 points 16 hours ago Those are rookie numbers permalink RedditStillSucks 8 points 16 hours ago ROOKIE NUMBERS! permalink CleanUpPhillyTrump24 7 points 16 hours ago There is likely no university or college not affected by this.

I think you would change your mind about this if you were to spend a few weeks at a typical university campus. I can't tell you how many mass emails I get about events put on by ethnic student clubs such as the "Indian Student Association" or "Muslim Student Association." I don't want more foreigners coming here to join and promote clubs that can be and are often hostile to native-born Americans who want a uniform American culture. permalink redditadminssuckit 1 points 15 hours ago https://patriots.win/p/19BtGYi3HF/aoc-responds-to-marco-rubios-rev/c permalink MEME-SUPREME 1 points 16 hours ago Rubio / Tulsi 2032 permalink JTIM OP 1 points 16 hours ago Vance/Gabbard through 2036 permalink Tmntnyc 1 points 15 hours ago This might have repurcissions for our country in the long run. Most foreign students aren't coming here to major in queer black gender art history, they're coming here to study mathematics, physics, neuroscience, chemistry, and engineering. While some go home after, most don't because they like it here and are hired by companies and contribute to our country's R&D. I've worked in academia for decades and American students just get worse and worse every year. They don't have the same drive or even respect for academic rigor as maybe they used to decades ago. There's going to be a brain drain if we boot out all the foreign students, mark my words. It's not like those numbers are being replaced with talented and eager American students. With generational budget cuts to academia from this administration, I wonder how Republicans think our military will fare in 30 years when we are a country of tradesman and blue collar workers, there's no innovation in tech to continue advancing new weapons technologies to stay #1 in military power. The folks who R&D crazy cutting edge shit are PhDs in the sciences, some of them homegrown but most of them foreign born, that we incentivize to live and work here. We aren't going to just fall from #1 to #2, especially when other countries start poaching what little homegrown talent we have left, with higher salaries. There's no since give to go to college anymore. Too expensive. permalink Fuck_commies_2024 1 points 14 hours ago There have to be parallel moves to find the American students are willing to work hard, have great potential. Hard to believe that they aren‚Äôt out there. permalink Beardholder 1 points 12 hours ago Need to have like 3 more 000s permalink PunishedOrange 1 points 15 hours ago thats it? its a nothing burger permalink zombie_sloth 0 points 11 hours ago did they say something naughty about the ones who cannot be criticized? permalink flashersenpai -2 points 16 hours ago The State Department official said between 200 and 300 of the visas pulled were over accusations that they engaged in "support for terrorism" under federal statute. The State Department is hiding it's Israel First actions by lumping Zionist activism into 6k other visa cases. They previously called writing a school blog post "support for terrorism" arrested the student in the NE, then sent them to Louisiana for deportation. Meanwhile, I'm not aware of any students who have been deported for writing posts critical of whites, christians, or America. In fact, it's taken extraordinary actions to even allow white South Africans into the United States. Something which likely only happened due to the influence of Elon Musk. see also The Trump administration has also imposed stricter screening for student visa applications. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced in April that international students, among other visa applicants, would have their social media screened for things including antisemitic content. The State Department has also required that student visa applicants make their social media profiles public. permalink flashersenpai 1 points 15 hours ago The reason I point this out is people are being fooled that wokeism/DIE is being attacked when in reality it's just changed forms. permalink friedchicken -3 points 16 hours ago He has such a little bitch face permalink makersmarx 1 points 16 hours ago Lol permalink friedchicken 0 points 16 hours ago Look how serious he think he looks! permalink sadSeagull0 1 points 16 hours ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink sadSeagull0 1 points 16 hours ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink BobSacano 1 points 14 hours ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink SqRt7744 0 points 8 hours ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink 1479 Marco Rubio revokes 6,000 foreign visas.
