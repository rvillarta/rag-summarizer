Bill Gates posted only ONE SHADY PHOTO OF ALLEDGEDLY TAKING HIS CORONA SHOT in 2021... doctors' face cropped no visible syringe before a window so the daylight darkens a bit the picture no video ! why ? one tweet and one shot only with a pic.. Bill Gates wasn't UP-TO-DATE on his covid vaccinations? Serious violator of the WHO recommendations!!! And he travelled without being proven to be up-to-date? Wow! Here the ONLY picture of him pretending to take one (and only one!) dose three days after Biden got installed in Jan 2021 : https://imgflip.com/i/a3kyne Said he wouldn't take it under Trump (available to him in December). No further tweet about taking dose number 2.... out of a 2 doses vaccine!!! It was SOLD as a two doses vax! You got two weeks between the two according to the Pfizer directives. He forgot to fabricate another picture for his second shot hahahahahaha! LooooooooL permalink tpactionchasethevote 2 points 10 hours ago You are also supposed to relax your arm during an injection. He's got his arm bent upwards. permalink 7PC_Principle 18 points 13 hours ago He never mentions rfk jr. This whole twitter post is fake and bullshit. Of course we know gates is a vax fanatic . Gates is bitching about funding cuts that's happening across the world, not just in US. permalink BidenShowerDrool 11 points 13 hours ago Correct...look at Soros, he seeded all the NGOs then USAID was forever paying the bills. Soros by comparison spent pennies for America to then go on to slit its own neck. All those Africans, Muslims and Indians making their way and then looked after and protected like Princes in the U.K, is all done with U.K taxpayer funds, but it was all originally funded and setup by Soros through his NGOs. .....pennies in the dollar is all it ever cost him to get his psychopathic will done. permalink BlackPilledMAGA 9 points 14 hours ago He needs another pie to the face permalink Wokism 12 points 13 hours ago A 9mm pie.

She loathes RFKjr because he is "threatening" vaccines. She is forever venting her spleen on facebook about the issue There is zero concern about vaccine injured kids, because she is brainwashed to believe Big Pharma is conflict-free science and that pharma companies are honest, altruistic actors. Unbelievable. I pity her patients. permalink Bouldabassed 14 points 13 hours ago Not to rag on your niece, but it's a tragedy people have been trained by society to assume doctors are very intelligent when really all that is required is a good memory and motivation. Just gotta be able to regurgitate everything you've learned when you're taking those tests. And when so much of what you've learned is based on a false foundation, the end result are those retarded Facebook rants. permalink MAGALADON9 4 points 12 hours ago We are going to allow "foreign doctors" to practice here, so soon medical professionals will be H1b'd in favor of a Turkmenistani "doctor" or a Congo brain surgeon. permalink Sgt_Hulka 13 points 13 hours ago Pediatricians are a joke. That job was made for female med school grads so they would have something to do after graduation. It‚Äôs the HR position of the medical field. I hate all pediatricians. They are vax pushers, nothing more. Your niece makes a nice bonus if she meets her vax targets. I loathe your niece more than she loathes RFK permalink joggin_noggin 2 points 2 hours ago I had a good pediatrician growing up. An actual doctor who practiced actual medicine. Helped me overcome persistent ENT infections by giving my parents a $20 medical device to strengthen/expand those passageways instead of the nth round of antibiotics, and it worked. I pity the tens of millions of American kids who will never see an actual doctor in their lives. permalink guidothekp 10 points 13 hours ago Vaccines are major source of revenue for pediatricians. permalink Filo76 6 points 13 hours ago üëÜüëÜüëÜ This is the correct answer.
