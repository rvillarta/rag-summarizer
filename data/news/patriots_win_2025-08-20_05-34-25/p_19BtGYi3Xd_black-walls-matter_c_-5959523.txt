According to AI, if the border patrol sets traps, or does things that can cause injury or harm, they can be sued. That steel gets HOT. The due process clause, of the Constitution, applies to illegal invaders inside the country. It only applies when the US government has jurisdiction over the individual. So they have to burn themselves on the American side, or burn themselves on the Mexican side and make it into the United States. permalink Trubs 7 points 13 hours ago üéµüé∂ I see a tall wall and I want to paint it black üéµüé∂ permalink xanaxagoras 7 points 14 hours ago I‚Äôm not at my computer but a ton of free Internet points to the first person who posts the Rolling Stones album cover with the faces replaced by Trump‚Äôs. permalink lul_cheto 7 points 14 hours ago Can we get some buckets of tar and bags of feathers on top as well? permalink BeekeepingPatriot 6 points 14 hours ago ‚ÄúPeople can buy a border wall in any color they like just as long as it‚Äôs black.‚Äù permalink Modernturnkey 6 points 13 hours ago Or we could just fuckin shoot them permalink GuerillaYourDreams 1 points 13 hours ago Just like she shot her dog. permalink Modernturnkey -3 points 12 hours ago I've shot exactly 4 of my hunting dogs, when they've got too old. My neighbor shot his dog for not barking when his garage got broken into. When the stray cats used to bring their kittens to my grandmother door, she'd fill up a bucket and toss them in. I'm so, so, so exhausted by people becoming soft and losing sight of reality. It's one of the reasons we're losing our country to spics, chinks, dunecoons, and bankers. It's amazing. You can murder a man's child and he'll forgive you. But if you shoot your own animal, they want HELL to be paid. permalink GuerillaYourDreams 3 points 12 hours ago I want you to say those exact same words to Jesus when he opens the book of life and asks you to be accountable for every one of your actions and thoughts and deeds‚Ä¶ God allowed Adam to name the animals and gave man dominion over the animals. That doesn‚Äôt mean to kill them like your grandmother did to drown a kitten. That‚Äôs just a sign of being a psychopath. permalink MocksFordComma 3 points 9 hours ago We have taken in and re-homed about 20 feral kittens in 3 years at our acreage. My wife doesn't work, so she cares for them one by one, vets them and gets them tame and does backgrounding for their new homes. After seeing the joy on the some of the new owners' faces (and their kids) and the truly privileged lives these animals enjoy in their new homes, it makes me shudder - I just can't imagine someone would like the poster above would post that with any sort of satisfaction. permalink view 2 more comments...

And if they had ticker numbers all over showing the number of covid deaths, there should be a ticker number showing deportations to date. permalink PowerOfBlues 1 points 13 hours ago The wall was never completed...... there were no "gates or whatever" to wave them through.....complete the wall and it won't be so easy for politicians in the future to make excuses about mass illegal immigration A completed wall across the entire southern border.....plus enforcement is the answer No way in hell that the supporters of mass illegal immigration are saying "let Trump build his stupid wall.. who cares...we'll just throw open the gates when we get back in power"..... They understand the power of a completed wall and they don't want it permalink yodayoda 0 points 12 hours ago you really have no idea what you're talking about, or how to think about this. even if it is true that the wall wasn't complete, yes border patrol still waved through millions (doesn't matter whether it was a gate, a checkpoint, or something else), and we even flew Lord only knows how many over, on the taxpayer's dime. complete the wall and it won't be so easy for politicians in the future to make excuses about mass illegal immigration I don't even see them making excuses, they just do it. having said that, YES, it will be just as easy for them to do it. No way in hell that the supporters of mass illegal immigration are saying "let Trump build his stupid wall.. who cares...we'll just throw open the gates when we get back in power" they don't have to say it, it's obviously what they will do. if you don't understand that, you understand nothing and are a moron to the nth degree. permalink griff 2 points 10 hours ago I see a red fence and I want to paint it black permalink MAGALADON9 2 points 12 hours ago üé∂ I see a rust wall and I want to paint it black... üé∂ permalink MAGALADON9 2 points 12 hours ago I checked: 140¬∞-180¬∞+ For context this is hotter than a black car in the sun.

Some can climb with just their feet with rubber grippy gloves as several online videos have shown. permalink Formerlurker92 1 points 8 hours ago Randomly electrify a few sections every day too permalink walls4america 1 points 8 hours ago While it‚Äôs true painting the wall black will make it hotter, I‚Äôm thinking there might be yet another reason for the paint job. Remember after the stolen election that the Biden administration let the rest of the unfinished wall materials be left to the elements and become deteriorated. Then they finally put the material up for auction to be sold for scrap, pennies on the dollar. But recently the auction returned this stolen wall material back to the government. By now, I don‚Äôt expect this neglected wall material will match the rest of the completed wall. But by painting the wall, all the wall will match. And while it‚Äôs being painted, why not choose black to make the wall hotter! permalink MissileToad 1 points 3 hours ago Whoa, talk about hot - but enough about Krisiti Noem, hey oooh! permalink knnbccb 1 points 8 hours ago Just have some sentries stationed there, anyone who climbs or even touches the wall without permission gets shot. permalink R3tro 1 points 11 hours ago Whoooooooo, caliente permalink HillarysFUPA 1 points 9 hours ago Use lead based paint, mofos! permalink TexasRepublic 1 points 12 hours ago Paint it Vanta Black, so you can‚Äôt even see it properly. permalink xanax123 1 points 10 hours ago They should add speakers playing creepy music‚Ä¶ permalink MJPalazzolo 1 points 11 hours ago Trump eluded to doing this during his first presidency, but was shouted down by the back stabbing infiltrators in his administration.
