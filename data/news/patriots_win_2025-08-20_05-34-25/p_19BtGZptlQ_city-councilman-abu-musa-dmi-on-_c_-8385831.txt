Islam is incompatible even with Islam. permalink 1MonkeyJr 6 points 6 hours ago True! permalink Friendly_B 5 points 3 hours ago Why is the border between Egypt and Gaza the most heavily fortified border in the world? permalink MedicallyReddit 10 points 8 hours ago They don’t belong anywhere. It’s a satanic death cult permalink Pepbrandt 1 points 5 hours ago How dare you assume their gender! permalink Liberals_R_Idiots 1 points 5 hours ago They don't belong on earth. permalink LogicCircuits 52 points 8 hours ago The thing that never happens happened permalink ModsAreCucked 32 points 8 hours ago This smalltime 70-IQ councilman can rig elections but the Biden-Clinton-Obama machine can’t possibly do that. permalink MSTRKRFTDNNR 10 points 4 hours ago It's ok... it's part of their culture to lie and cheat! permalink Nipplebuddy 5 points 2 hours ago It's also the Democrat culture permalink SpellingContable 1 points 4 hours ago Biden, Clinton and Obama? permalink RuleoVicus 25 points 8 hours ago It's an isolated incident. C'mon it only happens in 50 states, 3,144 counties, and 109,000 cities. You're blowing this out of proportion! permalink Prandogolio 12 points 8 hours ago There's no proof that it's wide spread so it's debunked. It can only be bunked when it's wide spread. permalink RuleoVicus 6 points 8 hours ago Thing I seem to see is, unlike the rest the of the world that just accepts 'voting results'... in the U.S. we are calling out the fraud. permalink Prandogolio 5 points 7 hours ago As bad as censorship is here, it's way worse in every other nation. So maybe they are calling it out, but it's just not being heard? permalink 37dwarves 1 points 6 hours ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink TellMeBoutIt 1 points 8 hours ago I read this in the old school South Park Saddam voice. Cmon guyyyy! permalink Tiredofstupidpeople 7 points 5 hours ago Voter fraud happens. A lot. What actually never happens is any kind of serious consequences for doing it. permalink BasedLaugh 1 points 13 minutes ago Right. Paging Pam Bondi… permalink TellMeBoutIt 21 points 8 hours ago Turning MI into Somalia, one ballot at a time permalink NukeTheTroons 1 points 37 minutes ago It disgusts me to the core. I know there are some based women, but they shouldn’t have the ability to vote. They vote with their feelings and their empathy is weaponized. permalink keeman 17 points 5 hours ago I'm about the least xenophobic person I know. Have friends from nearly every place on the planet. But I am getting really fucking tired of politicians and judges with names that sound like they came from a Star Wars movie. permalink plateowner2024 14 points 8 hours ago What's the response from Abu Musa when asked by reporters? permalink RuleoVicus 20 points 7 hours ago "Why are you Islamophobic?" permalink GoldenEarz 4 points 6 hours ago I’m not islamophobic, I’m anti-islam? permalink MayorMcSixaplix 12 points 6 hours ago Asked by reporters? permalink 37dwarves 1 points 6 hours ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink MericaFukYeah 13 points 8 hours ago Dem's and Liberal judges will accept..."It's Part Of Our Culture" permalink MakeCaliRedAgain 14 points 7 hours ago Its an election stealing emergency. permalink TexasRepublic 11 points 8 hours ago “Won” permalink tommygigantica 11 points 5 hours ago I remember they caught people doing this for Ilhan Omar... Still nothing happened to her to this day about it. She's illegitimate. This was a while ago. Yet we still have to listen to her dumbass low iq Somalian bullshit. Project veritas had something up August 5th, And nothing has happened. https://x.com/Project_Veritas/status/1820609722040398303 The media seems proud that Michigan is the first Muslim majority city council. It's obviously because they all cheated. And no one is doing a damn thing about it. permalink HunterBidensPC 7 points 7 hours ago I’d do that too if I saw how nobody got punished for it permalink Valensiakol 6 points 7 hours ago Look at the list of names one minute in. Literally all foreigners. permalink Boomstikchik 6 points 7 hours ago Is he being investigated and therefore arrested? In a court of law, cameras don't lie permalink AmericanMan00 4 points 7 hours ago Courts: No Standing! permalink BadBrainsBuzzcocks 4 points 8 hours ago This has been stickied about 8 times now. Obviously there are no updates on consequences. Lame. permalink MoreVanceMemes 4 points 8 hours ago Riggers gonna rig permalink IlhansBrother 4 points 7 hours ago I posted this like 3 days ago. And then it was sticked and awarded 2 days ago. permalink obar1 3 points 6 hours ago good boy permalink limenline 3 points 3 hours ago There is no accountability in America. permalink You_know_Whews 3 points 4 hours ago Wait, are we still thinking democracy is real just because one guy we wanted was elected to the president? Guys, the entire government is over run, this isn't a democracy or a republic. Until you fix the elections throughout, it's just an autocracy. And one guy on top for 3 more years....they can wait permalink justaddwater 2 points 1 hour ago So this is how you vote harder permalink OmegaBird 2 points 25 minutes ago But given that this is the USA, the Dems will face zero consequences. permalink Jappletime 2 points 5 hours ago RECALL permalink RomeIsFalling 2 points 5 hours ago If he is allowed to take actual power. I hate to say it but killing him is the only way to remove him. He has proven he will cheat in camera. Election cheating is treason and should be met with death. permalink SilentSniper 2 points 2 hours ago They got him now!!!! permalink MAGALADON9 2 points 1 hour ago He is gonna get such a sore wrist after the slippy slappin he's gonna get!! permalink FlyCatcher94 2 points 2 hours ago Best they can do is not talk about the investigation. permalink BrionK 1 points 6 hours ago For fuck sakes people. Get off your ass and clean up your shitty people. permalink 2Clutch 1 points 30 minutes ago Drop boxes = cheat boxes permalink Spacemonkey 1 points 3 hours ago Abu Fuckin Musa. That motherfucker owes me fiddy bucks. permalink Drcm 1 points 2 minutes ago its only the west that believes in rule of law. rest of the world lives by the rule of what you can get away with. permalink BlackLikeMyCovfefe 1 points 7 hours ago And? permalink Live_free_or_die_55 1 points 20 minutes ago Deport the POS ❗️ permalink DenturesNancy 1 points 40 minutes ago death penalty for anyone caught cheating in elections. To keep elections free and sacred, the punishment must be extreme and swift. permalink Logan051361 1 points 1 hour ago His opponent should be pissed. You know that this dude is a crooked fuck and should be removed off the ballot. But then again, so should Governor. permalink Redeemable 1 points 3 hours ago The Koran calls Allah the greatest deceiver. He is just following Allah. permalink RuleoVicus 1 points 8 hours ago Jews, Muslims, Panjeets... get rid of them all. 'Rid' can mean anything you want. permalink AmericanForever 1 points 5 hours ago 2 permalink plateowner2024 0 points 8 hours ago Reddit posters are saying he's Republican and claim he campaigned with Pres. Trump: https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1mtngbx/accused_ballot_stuffer_abu_musa_campaigning_with/ Pic with DJT looks fake to me but can't confirm. Ballotpedia lists him as "non-partisan" https://ballotpedia.org/Abu_A . Musa (Hamtramck_City_Council_At-large,_Michigan,_candidate_2025) Even if the pic was taken with DJT, a pic taken w/ a candidate doesn't prove he "campaigned with Trump." permalink RuleoVicus 5 points 7 hours ago Dude... that's so fucking fake, how are you unsure? permalink ThurstonHowell4th 1 points 1 minute ago It doesn't matter who he's in a photo with or what party he claims to be a part of. He needs to be investigated, arrested, and tried before a Court of Law. There is no excuse for this crap. As a nation, we need to say "No! You WILL go to jail." permalink 37dwarves 1 points 6 hours ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink f_bastiat 1 points 3 hours ago "darkened truck" sounds like you're trying to sell it like a gateway pundit article. It could have been on a moped, has nothing to do with the situation. Like when they use "quietly", I immediately question the integrity of the content. permalink NickAtNight 0 points 8 hours ago and? permalink RuleoVicus 3 points 8 hours ago It's a step in the right direction. Even having a local propaganda network make mention of election fraud was absolutely verboten 1, 2 year ago, ESPECIALLY for a Democrat Muslim. permalink madeaprofilejustforu 0 points 8 hours ago Do not redeem saar permalink ProudAmerican84 1 points 49 minutes ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink 37dwarves 1 points 6 hours ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink DadsTastyHouse 1 points 7 hours ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink Newhawk237 1 points 8 hours ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink 1014 City Councilman Abu Musa (D-MI) on tape stuffing ballots in middle of the night from darkened truck (second incident). posted 8 hours ago by Rosebud4Jesus 89 comments End Wokeness @EndWokeness • 3d HOLY SHlT City Councilman Abu Musa (D-MI) on tape stuffing ballots in middle of the night from darkened truck (second incident).
