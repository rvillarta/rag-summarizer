187 BANNON: What’s happening in NYC isn’t organic. It’s been planned for years. Just like Khan in London, this guy is backed by the same forces.

Not organic. permalink Trooph-Hurts 5 points 3 hours ago NYC started selling property to middle easterners after 2008 because they were the only one willing to buy the expensive property at inflated prices though it was worth NOTHING….. the purchase of the properties was more important than the price. …. This should tell you all you need to know…. This is an invasion paid for with your money buying VERY INFLATED FUEL,…. Foreigners do deserve such open access to our country but it’s by design, it’s all a fraud! permalink vegaspatriot1776 4 points 3 hours ago I am going to laugh my ass off when this commie mooslum wins control of NYC. A big run on popcorn is coming this fall. Be prepared! permalink A_Colostomy_Bag 4 points 3 hours ago Minneapolis too! permalink Modern_Times 1 points 30 minutes ago There is Federal law that prevents Communists from holding political office. Exercise the existing law and end this threat. permalink FusionBlack 1 points 9 minutes ago Islam is our biggest threat. permalink 187 BANNON: What’s happening in NYC isn’t organic.
