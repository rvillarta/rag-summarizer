I thought PACs could only be used to fundraise for the purpose of campaigning. A legal defense is not a political campaign. permalink HelluvaEngineer 34 points 11 hours ago There you go again... permalink HiimHillaryClinton 10 points 11 hours ago I‚Äôm a bitch, I‚Äôm a tease, I‚Äôma goddess on my knees. üéµ When you hurt when you suffer, I‚Äôm your angel undercover. üéµ permalink DonnieRamesJio 2 points 10 hours ago And you wouldn't have it any other way permalink Stir_Fried_Dog 6 points 9 hours ago I hear this song everyday, at least once, at work if I don't wear my earbuds. Got moved to slightly more advanced area, and my trainer is a guaranteed liberal voting, lesbian, adultering, knowledge monopolizing, boomer, divorcee cunt. Been forced to work with her the last 4 months, and the only music she'll let play is: 90's top 40 pop, modern top 40 country, and lady gaga about 80% of the day, and a smattering of Journey, 1 Survivor song, 1 Paula Abdul song, 1 Meatloaf song, a couple from Madonna and Cindy Lauper the other 20% of the day. Needless to say, I hate you all for making me feel like I'm back at work right now lmao ü§£ permalink view 2 more comments... Hanging_Chad 2 points 9 hours ago hi Hillary! üëãüèª permalink Spindle-spin 8 points 11 hours ago Didn't GEOTUS use his PAC to cover his legal expenses? I thought donating was like GoFundMe for electing him and making the Democrats waste their money permalink Snek_Plissken 9 points 10 hours ago That was a different scenario because he was actively campaigning. In this case, setting up a PAC specifically for legal defense is what makes it legal. permalink lefty295 6 points 10 hours ago You can, it‚Äôs a loophole due to retarded regulations. Thank Congress. permalink joggin_noggin 3 points 1 hour ago I don't think Congress writing the law in such a way that they benefit is retarded . Amoral, mercenary, self-serving... but not retarded. permalink MyDogCompletesMe 4 points 9 hours ago I think you can form a PAC for anything for which you fund-raise from others. The kicker is that it won't be tax deductible (I think 503c) when your donors donate their money. In fact, it's kinda the opposite. If you intend to fund raise and you exceed various $$$ limits or cross county/state lines with various donation amounts you're REQUIRED to form a PAC or stop receiving donations. Still of course, only some PACs are eligible for 503c status (tax deductible for donors). The cool thing here is that he must file quarterly financials which include donors info and how he's spending the money. Once those quarterlies have been published, anyone can look them up and file complaints which must be addressed. permalink BahamaDon 3 points 10 hours ago Faggots can do whatever they want to, you racist bigot! permalink PeregrineFalcon 1 points 8 hours ago A mirror must be the most vile thing to them, as they get to see their hypocrisy in themselves. permalink Neonentity 33 points 12 hours ago No USAID money?

He's reached his final form as a Senator I see. Some even say it's a position that's even more powerful than the President. A diabolical evil, that has to be an ethics violation and conflict of interest for a Senator to accept money when they are in office for a lawsuit that he could possibly be removed/impeached from over it permalink A_Colostomy_Bag 7 points 11 hours ago He had this made so his puppet masters could funnel in money to protect their investment. permalink Pdjco658 6 points 10 hours ago he's in quicksand. He's not indicted yet, so technically he's a free man just like you or me. But he's at oh this moment where you realize you have both feet stuck. The mud is covering just your feet but you know mentally what's going to happen and not knowing when it's going to happen is almost just as worse and knowing it will happen. permalink JimDandy 2 points 9 hours ago I will sleep well tonight with that thought in my mind. permalink BahamaDon 6 points 10 hours ago Huffington Post CONTRIBUTOR Steven Mele Political Finance Compliance specialist, writer, activist Steve Mele is a partner with MBA Consulting Group, a political finance compliance firm.
