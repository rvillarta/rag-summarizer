It was a probe of the limits, and honestly they found a serious exploitable real world tactic. And instead of seriously addressing it we laugh.. permalink MAGABOND 15 points 10 hours ago Well he ended up losing his seat, so that‚Äôs a win. permalink SquiggyMcPepe 1 points 5 hours ago Because he was a liability. This is a rapidly growing problem for the Ds because the useful idiots they roped in were not supposed to last this long. They thought they would get rid of Trump years ago but he kept hanging on so they had to not only keep their useful idiots on tap they started to weasel their way into the D power structures. In many ways we only have to outlast the Ds as they continue to implode. permalink glow-operator-2-0 12 points 10 hours ago Honestly, I'm done with words. That's just me though. permalink SquiggyMcPepe 2 points 5 hours ago Don't wait for us lead the way. permalink NadlersNads 2 points 5 hours ago Name checks out permalink Decepticons-superior 2 points 8 hours ago I actually forgot this story. What happened, again? permalink Skogin 2 points 10 hours ago https://patriots.win/p/17tLFgCeYy/jamaal-dont-let-the-fire-door-hi/c/ permalink Cuetardian 84 points 11 hours ago Be aware of the term narcissistic rage. That's exactly what we're seeing here. Narcissists/sociopaths of every kind rely on lies, bribes, threats and manipulation to stay in control of everyone else. But when narcs/sociopaths realize that their bullshit isn't working anymore, and the lies fall apart and people begin to see them for what they really are, they become furiously angry. That's when they start lashing out with physical violence. That's because they don't have any other way to get people to do what they want. And as long as they're still not getting what they want - which is to be proved right, get their power and control back, and have Trump and MAGA disappear forever - the Left will only become more and more enraged and violent and destructive. Never forget this. Be aware of your surroundings 24/7. It's almost certain to get worse before it can be stopped. permalink Angryhotdog 23 points 11 hours ago Damn J6‚Äôers weren‚Äôt this armed permalink cjcivicx 32 points 11 hours ago They weren't armed at all... permalink Angryhotdog 16 points 11 hours ago I was told a police officer had his head bashed in with a fire extinguisher and 100 cops were killed by impalement promoting 10 cops die by suicide.

The whole political climate with these fucking retarded ass leftists is the reason why I keep a rifle and some rifle plates. I don't leave the house without my AR-15 being somewhere in my vehicle. I always got a pistol on me at least permalink RedTX 1 points 29 minutes ago Same here, I am always concealed carry, even if just making a quick trip to grocery store. Minimum carry is a J Frame or small Glock. Enough to stop a threat, or at least get you to the truck to GTFO. permalink glow-operator-2-0 6 points 10 hours ago the Left will only become more and more enraged and violent and destructive Good. I think it's time we finish Reconstruction. permalink MAGA9428 5 points 10 hours ago Honestly, I don't think the woke left is going to survive this term. They are getting humiliated on a nearly daily basis now. Cutting USAID and other corrupt money laundering schemes in the government is turning off the money spigot they need to spread their ideology. Their stranglehold on the culture has broken and now that its gone... I don't see it coming back for a long time because everyone is so sick and tired of wokeness. The few countries left that still embrace woke ideology (UK, Canada, Germany, Sweden, Australia, France, ect) have turned into the world's laughing stock. They get made fun of all the time on social media. I feel like the perception of woke countries now is almost as negative as the perception of really far right Middle Eastern countries. permalink glow-operator-2-0 3 points 8 hours ago I don't think the woke left is going to survive this term They needn't survive at all. Either they off themselves, or someone else will. That's their choice now. permalink Formerlurker92 3 points 8 hours ago I think this is the best explanation I've seen on this permalink Th3Cho0sing0ne 29 points 12 hours ago Mostly peaceful Democracy permalink -f-b-i- 26 points 12 hours ago Gavin is to blame. permalink Taqiyya_Mockingbird 25 points 12 hours ago Predictable permalink IAmRetard 19 points 11 hours ago This only ends when there are consequences permalink HelluvaEngineer 17 points 12 hours ago Just some joggin' goin' on. permalink bigdickhangsright 16 points 11 hours ago Or another tranny tragedy permalink DingleBalls 14 points 11 hours ago Another set-up to blame a "crazy right wing ahooter threatening left wing protesters" permalink Luvs_2_Bop 11 points 12 hours ago Probably wouldn‚Äôt be a bad thing to clean that place out‚Ä¶.Texas ‚ÄúRepublicans‚Äù have been very disappointing in recent years Edited to add ‚Äú ‚Äú permalink Nothing007 17 points 12 hours ago The Texas government has been taken hostage by fake "Republicans" who are doing everything they can to destroy the state. permalink Luvs_2_Bop 11 points 11 hours ago That‚Äôs pretty much my comment‚Äôs point. Not sure why it‚Äôs so unpopular permalink KekistanPM 3 points 10 hours ago Many people don't realize it. I didn't know this until a few years ago; and it explains a lot. permalink Taylor3006 2 points 9 hours ago They are not fakes, they are not RINOs. They are Bush era establishment republicans of the "compassionate conservative" variety. They still hold sway in Texas, MAGA politicians are way outnumbered by their ilk. permalink AngelMark2 1 points 1 hour ago It‚Äôs one big UNIPARTY grift! permalink Bldg_2019 -6 points 11 hours ago Nah, you‚Äôre a out of state troll or a blazed out of their mind Ron Paul retard pothead living in the swamp if you think that.

Lashing out after losing in court. permalink LokiHelmsdeep 6 points 9 hours ago President Trump needs to Deputize 100,000 MAGA people and let us take care of business. So many problems would be completely solved less than 1 week after organizing. permalink MythArcana 6 points 11 hours ago Chick at the end of the clip with the sign has a poor grasp of English grammar.

But sure they care enough to protest district maps... Paid "protesters" aren't a thing. They're the democrat's private paramilitary of agitators and terrorists. permalink doomerglowie 1 points 8 hours ago We live in a nation with peoples that have incompatible cultures.
