I don’t even consider him a 46th president. Pedo did nothing but be a puppet for his overlords for 4 years while shitting his pants and eating ice cream. permalink TravisRSCX 34 points 14 hours ago We got to get people in place to write the correct history in history books otherwise this cycle will replicate long term... permalink NotYourMan 11 points 13 hours ago We have already watched history get re-written. The 1619 project has now re-written what happened in 1619 when the ship landed on the coast of Virginia. The white hating publishers are more than happy to take government money and re-write history, ignoring the good that Europeans did (like abolishing slavery (William Wilberforce)) and making all of history about the bad things that the "colonizers" did. Damn, Europeans should have kept the technology and conquered the world, oppressing everybody. You would think that is what happened. permalink LLP2 9 points 12 hours ago That's what I keep telling people. Whites are the most inept "oppressors" ever to end up as less than 10% of global population while being more than 90% responsible for lifting the condition of the world's people into the modern age. permalink Meatsuit 1 points 7 hours ago Christians permalink Twitter PRO 7 points 13 hours ago they all go for the dementia defence at the end of the day permalink Bedminster 8 points 13 hours ago Robert Mueller has entered the chat permalink CommanderOfCheese 4 points 12 hours ago Robert Mueller has no idea where he is. permalink 5DchessWatch 2 points 9 hours ago Robert Mueller is unsure if Robert Mueller is actually Joe Biden Joe Biden doesn't know either permalink chickeninoven 3 points 13 hours ago Only because he thought it was a pizza parlor permalink Protonboy 1 points 11 hours ago While denying that he had dementia. permalink d003 4 points 13 hours ago no judicial appointments count permalink WhitePowerRanger 2 points 8 hours ago And falling up the stairs. permalink aaafirefly123 1 points 13 hours ago He was semi-cognizant for a while in the beginning, But by the end of his term the dementia had fully set in and he was nothing but a vegetable. permalink Mungo 36 points 14 hours ago All those pardons are null and void permalink BidenShowerDrool 24 points 14 hours ago All Pardons via AutoPen need to be made null and void. Autopen usage need to be defined and mainly used for presidential contracts for when the Pres. in not in DC. There is no reason for the President to not sign all their EO and Pardon knowing full well what they are signing. I'd also go so far as saying that every EO and Pardon needs to be recorded for future proof. permalink NotYourMan 7 points 13 hours ago Joe Biden and his team got paid and they love chaos. Remember those people let out went to live somewhere and that increased the population so that democrats could get more seats in the house. Its ALWAYS about money or power for democrats. permalink Now_On_to_Mars 4 points 12 hours ago it should only be for souvenirs permalink NZbacon 4 points 12 hours ago Especially pardoning his whole family. permalink NotYourMan 3 points 13 hours ago Did anybody track the race of the criminals let out? permalink ColonelKlink 20 points 14 hours ago Arrests? permalink MyBallsAreRough 10 points 13 hours ago HAHAHAHAHAHAHA permalink SavingPrivateGrace 17 points 14 hours ago Unbelievable that the only people who follow the laws are workers in this country that need their jobs to survive. Once you get into a government job, anything goes so milk it, fuck it up, bleed it dry, take more than you'll ever need and laugh at the stupid people working to follow the laws. Gee, I wonder why no one was arrested yet. permalink UCantStumpTheTrump 2 points 8 hours ago It makes you feel like a sucker for making an honest living permalink MythArcana 8 points 14 hours ago If we're talking about autopen, then why isn't everything nullified already? We already know his crew was accepting $550k per pardon, we know autopen was used for this process, we know who was behind this scheme, so where are the arrests and nullifications? permalink goldkeyboardwarrior 5 points 13 hours ago If we're talking about autopen, then why isn't everything nullified already? It would most likely have to go through SCOTUS to nullify it all. After Trump posted on Truth that the autopen pardons were void he was asked about it by the press and he said he believed they were void but it would have to go through the courts. https://x.com/cspan/status/1901629350283264448?s=61&t=-zCyR-0Wpkvhc2o78LGQZA permalink MythArcana 2 points 13 hours ago Thanks for the reply, and that's what I was afraid of, honestly. permalink the-new-style 1 points 5 hours ago But the process could start with arrests - there's no point nullifying pardons unless there are prosecutions on the table. Let's hear the case against Fauci for instance. There would be more pressure if the public heard the crimes these people were getting away with. And these are federal pardons, why aren't the states doing something? permalink NotYourMan 4 points 13 hours ago It takes many months to build a case like this and then indict the criminals in Joe's administration. Lets just hope they can get it before 2026 when the house changes to democrat. permalink JoinTheDiscussion 2 points 13 hours ago Blondie's RIGHT on it!!! permalink jamesbcrazy 8 points 14 hours ago And what will be done about this? Nothing. permalink TheDespotofCartoons 5 points 13 hours ago OK, so we have evidence of what we knew all along. WHAT GOOD IS THAT EVIDENCE IF WE DO FUCK ALL ABOUT IT?! It's like that Chris Farley meme...FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DO SOMETHING! permalink Choomguy 5 points 13 hours ago Hanging is too good for that piece of shit permalink AVeryNakedMan 5 points 14 hours ago Somebody in the media ask Joe Biden why he commuted the Kids for Cash judge. permalink NotYourMan 1 points 13 hours ago Joe Biden loves created chaos like any good democrat. In chaos they can steal from the tax payers and justify more government, more government overreach, let liberty. Chaos is part of the democrat plan to overthrow the constitution. permalink KernalMustard 1 points 11 hours ago A man once said.

Jesus. permalink CommanderOfCheese 1 points 12 hours ago Time to challenge the legitimacy of the pardons not by just arguing, but by prosecuting the people who were pardoned on the bases of: pardons are for existing crimes, serving as admissions of guilt for a specific crime. Open ended pardons do not specify a crime and there is therefore no immunity granted. the executive did not take the action to pardon in sound mind. permalink BidenTaintMyPrez 1 points 9 hours ago I want to upvote this... but it's GWP... I want to believe... please don't let me down permalink Farqquard 1 points 14 hours ago man, that gave me a justice boner. permalink Diana 1 points 13 hours ago So any autopen EO or pardon needs to be nuflified unless it's PROVEN he personally signed tt. permalink Immafancyboy 1 points 14 hours ago You shouldn’t be signing so many damn pardons that you even need an auto pen. permalink Creepy_Joe 1 points 9 hours ago When there are no arrests the door will be wide open for even worse. permalink AslanFan 1 points 12 hours ago It's really refreshing to see facts objectively laid out. Even TGP doesn't always do that. permalink Texasnumber1 1 points 14 hours ago They are all accomplices to this crime permalink KOMMISSARofMAGA 1 points 12 hours ago Israel.
