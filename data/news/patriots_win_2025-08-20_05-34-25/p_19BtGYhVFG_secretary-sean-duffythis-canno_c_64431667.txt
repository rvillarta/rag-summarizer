You cannot trust liberal states. All cdl drivers should have an automatic in person renewal with on the road test conducted by feds. Everyone currently with a cdl has a 1 year grace to schedule and pass the new testing. All cdls issued by states will now have a 1yr expiration with an expiration of sept 1,2026. My thoughts anyway. permalink Madnote1984 28 points 15 hours ago Fuck you. I'm not jumping through a bunch of bullshit hoops to solve a government created problem. This entire issue can be solved in two years by requiring drivers to read a random section of the FMCSA handbook and writing a paragraph in English on a lined form that's then included in the long-form physical paperwork. This can be done at the bi-annual physical that is required and signed off by the federal certified physician. Every CDL holder in the country will have to have this done by today's date in 2027. I already can't renew online, pay more for my license, pass regular random drug tests, and have a physical every two years. Why should I suffer more bullshit? The damned US DOT and FMCSA can suspend company operations for many reasons. All trucking companies are issued a DOT# to operate under. Tomorrow, they could send out warnings saying if you are found to be employing someone who cannot read or speak English your company will suffer license suspension and review. They can also use data to find out where all these illegals are testing and target them, and/or shit those schools down. The rest of us are professional and are citizens. They created this problem. Don't burden me with it. permalink dr_gonzo 6 points 14 hours ago The "drug" tests slay me. The government thinks a white guy with a 125 IQ is less capable of driving an 18 wheeler on Monday because he smoked a joint on Saturday, than an illegal immigrant that can't even speak English. Not to mention, I'm pretty sure they don't test for alcohol, which absolutely impairs your driving more than any other drug I'm aware of except maybe LSD or shrooms or something. Even then it's a close call. It's so damn arbitrary. But I agree with you. I'm not in favor of centralizing licensing power. Anytime someone on our side thinks centralizing power may be a good idea they need to reconsider whether or not they're being manipulated. A core tenet of leftism is the centralization of power. permalink AussieTrumpFan 4 points 12 hours ago Have you ever encountered a drug-impaired driver on the road before? Let alone one piloting a semi-trailer? I'm all for truck drivers receiving the same medical consideration as pilots (and should be paid commensurate, too...). permalink SomethingNondescript -1 points 12 hours ago Fuck you.

I suggested a small amendment to the already required process that would take about 5 minutes. Dumbass... With arguments like this, no wonder your original idea was so stupid. You clearly misunderstand the current process to obtain and maintain a CDL as my suggestions were simple fixes to already required processes , instead of your idiotic nonsense. permalink view 1 more comments...

The outrage will subside, but the cause will not be dealt with. I am a long haul driver. I see accidents like this often. The American Trucker Association, along with large carriers like SWIFT, Schneider, JB Hunt, and others deliberately caused a retention problem, not a driver shortage, by bringing in foreign workers who work for slave wages. The industry is corrupt, and good drivers simply cannot compete with the firehose of incompetent drivers and companies willing to cut every corner and race to the bottom for cheap freight rates. Until the narrative of ‚Äúdriver shortage‚Äù stops and switches to the real problem of retention by allowing actual market rates pay companies and drivers a reasonable wage and profit, this will keep happening. permalink Badfinz_FL 27 points 16 hours ago ^^^ This pede trucks ^^^ (Close relative was the director of safety at Carroll Fulmer, now out of business) permalink glow-operator-2-0 24 points 16 hours ago Snitch on the carriers and alert ICE of where to focus enforcement. permalink live_free 17 points 15 hours ago Get James O‚ÄôKeefe to station undercover lot lizards across the country. permalink HeavyMetalPatriot 9 points 15 hours ago TOP KEK!!!

The truck drivers of today are fucking idiots. I can't believe that insurance companies aren't forcing trucking companies to crack down on qualifications. permalink Maskurbator 3 points 9 hours ago They probably are. But policies sometimes have grace periods for new hires, so couriers might be exploiting loop holes and shit like that to avoid higher premiums. But just like with cops, it ain't that the rules don't exist, it's lack of enforcement probably because for DECADES they never needed to. In a white monoculture, rule breaking of this magnitude was never dreamt of. So it was like a cop that never had to give speeding tickets because no one sped, and eventually he stopped hiding under the overpass. The enforcement arm got rusty. But now, people skirt the rules so much they have to relearn enforcement. The problem is every company got relaxed and the first one to get strict will lose business to competitors. It's good in the long run because you aren't paying claims like OP video BUT its hard in the short term when you lose cash flow. permalink ArtLife 5 points 14 hours ago I totally get it. I'm not a driver, but used to do lots of LTL freight and got numerous cold sales calls from brokers, lots of crazy stories from drivers about the nutty rules at various DC's or even the Jaxport shipyard here in FL.

Basically someone without any driving experience can go in there and get a CDL in under 10 days for $1,000 or less. permalink BrickBradford 9 points 14 hours ago Wait - they are actually named Punjab?

Only now, that thousands are dead, do we care to address the issue. But rest assured, nothing will be done, and the drivers and general public will continue to suffer. The only way to stop all of these is to revoke any and ALL H1B or any work visas, and immediately deport everyone. Otherwise, the mega carriers and the durka squad will continue to do this shit, and push ordinary Americans out of work, and into the poverty wages category. permalink PastorCharles 8 points 16 hours ago I never thought about this until now, but we're in California and two Indian-owned and Indian-operated trucking companies flank the property of our church. permalink glow-operator-2-0 8 points 16 hours ago If their operators cannot read or speak conversational English, it's grounds for an investigation. permalink thisaintitchief76 5 points 10 hours ago Call ICE man.

He signed some kind of bill or executive order allowing it. Then suddenly everyone who was restricted to taking the bus, the metro and other public transit were able to drive cars which increased traffic exponentially. permalink orange_popcicle 2 points 15 hours ago It sounds like states need to open up old weigh stations and state patrol needs to start checking truckers so they have all of their papers in order. Any company that has their loads seized and drivers barred/deported would be responsible for picking up their deliveries or face massive fines for leaving things unattended on the highways. permalink mailinvoter 2 points 16 hours ago It's sickening that the faggots allowing this to happen, and supporting it, are the same faggots that kept saying "if it saves even one life" during covid. We need to label the demonrat party/leftists as a global terrorist organization and lock all the mentally ill faggots up. permalink raid 2 points 15 hours ago There must be consequences for the state bureaucracy.

The problem with illegals is that once one company starts using them to cut rates, pressure forms on all other companies to do the same thing or go out of business. This is why I think all the big food companies are rolling over so meekly on the artificial dye thing. A federal crackdown shifts responsibility and allows the company to make that change.

"official" estimates for foreign drivers are nearly 20% but the Punjabi trucker association claims they makeup 20% of over the road truck drivers themselves.
