    "article_summary": "Israel has targeted and destroyed nearly 80% of aid facilities in Gaza, leaving Palestinians with limited access to basic necessities such as food, medicine, and shelter. The aid crisis is exacerbated by the low number of aid trucks entering Gaza and Israeli restrictions on vital food items. The death toll in Gaza has risen to at least 70 Palestinians, including 18 aid seekers, in the past 24 hours.</s>"
