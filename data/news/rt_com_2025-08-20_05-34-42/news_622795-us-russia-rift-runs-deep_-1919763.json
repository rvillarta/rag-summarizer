    "article_summary": "US-Russia tensions persist despite Trump-Putin summit, with fears of a deepening East-West divide. The recent Armenia-Azerbaijan peace deal, brokered by the US, is seen as a geopolitical win for Turkey, particularly due to potential land links and increased influence. Observers anticipate similar US-engineered deals in Georgia and Moldova, with potential for conflict over disputed territories, such as Transnistria in Moldova. This could lead to a broader standoff between Europe and Russia, with Greece, Romania, and Turkey's stances being crucial factors.</s>"
