335 You abused your security clearance by bad mouthing the President while having your clearance. You have been badmouthing him for years. Now you don’t have a clearance. You signed the 2019 letter. Everything I said is accurate. Enjoy losing your Kentucky Senate race too, loser. posted 6 hours ago by PiratePatriotParrot PRO 30 comments Laura Loomer @LauraLoomer • 13h You abused your security clearance by bad mouthing the President while having your clearance.

Joel Willett @realJoelWillett • 13h Fact Check: I didn't have a security clearance in 2019. You can't "abuse" something you don't have. One hell of a scoop, Laura. 30 comments Belleoffreedom 6 points 5 hours ago So, who's lying here? It's hard to tell. permalink SanityGumby 19 points 3 hours ago He is. He had a security clearance. And it was revoked yesterday. So he is lying. permalink COLDWARPATRIOT55 7 points 1 hour ago Laura is rarely wrong. She researches down to the last speck of dust on most people. permalink flashersenpai 1 points 28 minutes ago She was wrong twice in the past month and consistently attacks actual America First people like MTG and Massie. permalink Tookens 4 points 5 hours ago "That depends on what the meaning of 'is' is." permalink PatPede1 2 points 5 hours ago Both? That seems to be the most likely answer in political circles. permalink CleanUpPhillyTrump24 1 points 5 seconds ago LL is a good journo. Better than the MSM that's for sure. She's got the goods if she says she has them. permalink CleanUpPhillyTrump24 1 points 35 seconds ago Hahaha smack. permalink flashersenpai 1 points 24 minutes ago My first guess was that he must have said something about Israel, but if he's on that letter he's an asshole anyway. permalink LikeAWombatScorned 1 points 34 minutes ago I wouldn't even care if he was bad-mouthing President Trump. Signing the 2019 letter is the egregious part. permalink YouAreIgnorant -1 points 25 minutes ago JEWISH MAGA AT ITS VERY BEST. I LOVE LAURA LOOMER. permalink Impotent_Weasel 2 points 19 minutes ago I’ll take 1000 Amish over 1 Jew. permalink SqRt7744 -20 points 3 hours ago Loomer is a worthless israel firster. Her latest big success was sucessfully getting her controlled puppet Rubio to deny special medical treatment visas for Palestinian kids with serious injuries / medical conditions that can't be treated in razed gaza. Yay!? Gtfooh you psycho bitch. permalink SanityGumby 12 points 3 hours ago Go back to India faggot permalink SqRt7744 2 points 4 minutes ago This site in a nutshell. Used to be principled conservatives and meme lords, now it's Israel first retards who are probably literally in Israel, their country of citizenship. Too late though, you can't turn back the clock in America first, even if you retain Boomer loyalty. permalink Ligersrule1 3 points 3 hours ago Fuck ALL semites! permalink TheCandiru 0 points 42 minutes ago Christians are semites permalink Ligersrule1 2 points 34 minutes ago Early Christians, yes permalink flashersenpai 2 points 25 minutes ago She is absolutely Israel First. It's why she keeps going after MTG and Massie. permalink thisperson -1 points 1 hour ago We don’t have UHC or whatever free healthcare is here in the US. That pissed you off for some reason? Some faggot’s bill of virtue signaling not getting into the grift. permalink flashersenpai 0 points 26 minutes ago As far as I know the medical event was privately funded. Frankly it's ghoulish to send billions to a country to blow up kids then later call the injured children terrorists and deny humanitarian aid. permalink Impotent_Weasel 1 points 17 minutes ago Naw fuck them, let Europe deal with them invaders with their free healthcare, THAT WE PAY FOR. America First and fuck anyone without a US citizenship or dual citizenship. permalink thisperson 1 points 15 minutes ago God sees in reductionist pov. A land of people who sympathize with a terrorist government at the helm. The sin of the parents paid sevenfold, generations. permalink thisperson 1 points 14 minutes ago The part about not paying the sins of the parents is for I, God-lover. permalink 335 You abused your security clearance by bad mouthing the President while having your clearance.
