Dogs are objectively one of the most useful animals on the planet. They have had important roles in almost every human society going back to before recorded history. Their fate has been entwined with ours for a very long time. They are wonderful creatures. permalink jtowers2255 18 points 3 hours ago Odd that dogs who are at least slightly spiritually sensitive and can tell intentions and character with smells and observation don’t seem to like muslims. Interesting correlation. permalink Watermelons 8 points 1 hour ago They also generally dislike the mailman, ups drivers, and black people. permalink PenguinOfDoom 5 points 1 hour ago My dog likes to chill on his bed in the front yard. He wags his tail at most everyone who walks by. Until, a homeless druggie, walks or bikes by, and he goes nuts. He does this to anyone who looks remotely shady. permalink PirateLaffite 1 points 17 minutes ago Thats because mailmen and delivery drivers walk right up to the dog's "turf," someting they instinctually protect. My dog is like that. Friendliest dog in the world when she is out and about, but is Cujo reincarnated if someone walks up to the house or car while she is inside. With respect to black people, my personal opinion is that dogs are attuned to their owner's emotions. So if the owner has a negative emotion when a black person is near, the dog picks up on that, and respond in kind. Or, it could be black people are more likely to be afraid of dogs, have the rush of adrenaline, when their near a dog, and the dog picks up on that. permalink Easzq8 6 points 2 hours ago Some theorize that just as we domesticated the wolf, the dog domesticated us. Guess that explains why Muslims are closer to beasts. permalink Bobf 5 points 2 hours ago Dogs were the very first animals domesticated by humans, estimated 12 to 15 thousand years ago (some studies indicate possibly 30 thousand years!!). They have been with us since the beginning. permalink LordNewport 2 points 43 minutes ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink Choomguy 17 points 4 hours ago We are gonna need a lot more german shepherds to clean this country up.
