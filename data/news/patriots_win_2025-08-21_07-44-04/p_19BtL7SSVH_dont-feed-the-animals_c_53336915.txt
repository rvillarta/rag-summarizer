You can’t help the sea turtle get to the sea you can’t dig it out of the ground. You can’t shine lights and different things and you’ve gotta leave it completely alone because the survival of its species demand that you not help it……. OK, I buy into that. So what the hell is our government? permalink DadsTastyHouse 1 points 1 hour ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink killedmytv 4 points 56 minutes ago Kind of like "if you feed the weeds, you get more weeds". permalink Oback_Barama 3 points 36 minutes ago Not to mention that the animals won’t just become dependent on the handout, but will start to expect handouts from all humans it comes in contact with and will become aggressive if that human doesn’t give it a handout. It does however result in them consistently voting democrat. permalink Stlpoolguy 1 points 53 minutes ago Bingo permalink DadsTastyHouse 1 points 1 hour ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink 218 Don't Feed The Animals posted 4 hours ago by rdvs34283 6 comments
