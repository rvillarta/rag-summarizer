Came here to say that. permalink staroframphansbhole 24 points 14 hours ago PLEASE DO IT, the following Assachusetts areas are a hornet's nest ripe for deportation operations: Boston (especially East Boston) Revere Chelsea Everett Lynn Lawrence Somerville Cambridge Medford Malden Quincy Lowell permalink GarbageManCan47 13 points 13 hours ago Holy fuck this is so accurate. Used to live there. Lawrence is soooo bad. And Medford! Brings back memories of shitty 130 decibel bass boosted Latino pop... Worcester is probably a good one too. And please clean up Hyannis so the kids can roam around the arcades and shops again! Edit: Don't forget New Bedford and Fall River! Give the south shore some love! permalink staroframphansbhole 6 points 13 hours ago Yeah it's terrible but always a easy to identify them in their Honda Accords with illegally tinted windows and spoilers (they are obsessed with ricing Accords). Figured ICE could start in the highest population density places and then move south and west. Springfield and that whole area is probably also a nightmare. permalink GarbageManCan47 5 points 13 hours ago Yes Springfield is also a dump. It's a shame because I never got to visit the armory museum there because I had no interest into traveling to and visiting Springfield. Maybe I will once the illegals are gone and section 8 is cut bigly. Maybe the city will gentrify the and actually be nice. Edit: old honda prelude hatch backs are riced up by them as well! I usually see them in the Providence area though in RI. permalink SeamusOtardy 1 points 5 hours ago Thursday night is a hot night to hit the Hampton Beach strip. My guess is authorities could find all the probable cause they need by using their nose. permalink Seeker_17 2 points 6 hours ago Yes, Lynn, Lowell, Lawrence, the Three L's, are shitholes now. Revere is where the Boston bombers lived and culturally enriched. permalink SeamusOtardy 1 points 5 hours ago Lawrence should be WAY the fuck up on that list! I worked in that city 6 years ago and it was a madhouse for illegals and some of the most blatant, in-your-face welfare fraud. I can only imagine what it‚Äôs looking like now. And that was just the residents. Peel back the rind on the local government and take a look! Remember Mayor Willy Lantigua and his garbage trucks!? permalink AccipiterQ 5 points 13 hours ago Central Mass....small towns now are flooded with these hotels that the stake has booked up filled with illegals. permalink Quiznos585 4 points 13 hours ago Don‚Äôt forget Fall River & New Bedford permalink mlp67 3 points 13 hours ago Framingham permalink elvisbird OP 3 points 12 hours ago You hit the choice community üëè permalink EvilGreed209 20 points 14 hours ago Get these CCP SPies outta here already. Back in my day we wouldn't put spy chinks in positions of power but when you install leaders who can't balance a budget on purpose and steal all the money then u gotta start selling off the country to appease the whopping trillions USA owes china from borrowing all the god damn time then have the nerve to say best economy and stockmarket in the world knowing u have a 37 trillion unpayable debt where u can't even knock off any principle hell u can't even knock off any interest fucking useless. permalink airborne3502 15 points 14 hours ago Good I don't think there was a Chinaman in the colonies when the founding fathers were getting together in Boston. permalink mass55th 4 points 13 hours ago Didn't you ever hear how the Founding Fathers ordered out from the neighborhood Chinese restaurant when they were writing the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution? They did extremely well with chopsticks, and not the one you play on the piano. permalink splink 5 points 13 hours ago Probably says that on wikipedia.

My sense is that people will forgive him for getting into massive confrontations. They will not forgive him for avoiding showdowns. We basically hired this guy to get into the showdowns, bitter battles and fights, and confrontations that we could not. This is why the H1B and foreigners taking jobs issue has metastasized for him. He's not getting into the nasty fight that we need him to. If he keeps fighting hard and fast on crime tho, it'll be huge. It'll be a whole new way of doing things. which it needs to be. This is why we elected him. We elected the man to get in fights for us. permalink raptormissle 2 points 12 hours ago My sense is that people will forgive him for getting into massive confrontations. What? People are angry he's not getting into massive confrontations with these vile illegal alien protecting democrat states. The majority of the US population voted for this. They are defying the will of the people. They are the real insurrectionists. permalink vongregormench 2 points 11 hours ago Los Angeles was a pretty big confrontation on illegals and he doubled down. permalink Jnicolet4431 7 points 12 hours ago This is what I voted for. Arrest that communist bitch permalink LabTech 7 points 13 hours ago Both Wu and Healey need to be perp-walked out of Beacon Hill, cuffs covered by an overcoat, and into a black SUV on the way to Federal Court. MA is a third Republican, myself included, and it's gerrymandered to fuck. Both Wu and Healey are clearly putting party loyalty and scoring points they intend to cash later before the interests of the constituency. It also doesn't help us that MA is one of the few states that legislatively has an obligation to house every MF'er that wanders over the state border. Property values anywhere close to Boston are STUPID, meaning it's impossible to afford a house, and impossible to sell one, unless it's to Blackrock. Make no mistake, our state earned it's reputation as being full of libtards, but even the diehard members of my family are waking up to the fact that the Democrat party isn't doing them any favors, but we're going to need help from Trump to force our way into having a snowball's chance to claw back some autonomy for the people. permalink raptormissle 6 points 12 hours ago Why is this stupid bitch continually allowed to break the law and get away with it? Federal law has supremacy over state law. She's breaking the law. Arrest that Chinese noodle and cook her in prison where that vile bitch belongs. permalink Coin-Op 1 points 11 hours ago Wait, I thought a state's constitution supersedes the US Constitution? permalink splink 4 points 13 hours ago PLEASE do Portland next. please ... permalink elvisbird OP 3 points 12 hours ago That's bad too permalink Owmyballz 4 points 12 hours ago Good. Turn Boston into a full fucking circus. permalink Rosebud4Jesus 4 points 7 hours ago Should be flooding Boston already no matter what. The Mayor needs to be investigated and prosecuted for obstructing the law and helping illegal aliens continue to break the law. If arrests and prosecutions don't start happening then nothing will change. The mayors act tough like they care about the illegals knowing that the illegals will get deported but nothing will happen to the mayors.

This will be embraced by true Bostonians with open arms. permalink elvisbird OP 3 points 12 hours ago Boston and the surrounding cities are full of illegal drug and sex criminals. They should not be allowed to commit crime after crime and walk free to do it again.
