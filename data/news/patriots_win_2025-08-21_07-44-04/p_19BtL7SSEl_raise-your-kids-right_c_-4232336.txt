We of course signed up for this service & we pay him $5 a week. 23 comments R3Dpill 14 points 3 hours ago I just made the same deal $5 with my neighbors kid. They are thrilled to earn money. permalink bill_in_texas 7 points 1 hour ago Good friends of mine, the wife is complaining about the husband being a procrastinator, and one of her complaints was that the husband wouldn't take the garbage out. She was fixated on that. I told her to pay a neighbor kid to do it, just like this story. For a few bucks a week, that terribly important issue could be solved and over with. She chose to leave the husband, a guy with a good job, a good family man, who helped raise good kids, instead. I don't get it. permalink Bandanna1 7 points 1 hour ago Lol my wife never closes a fucking cabinet. Guess I'll get a divorce. permalink 24601 4 points 56 minutes ago It wasn't just the garbage can. It never is. However, the wife was probably a nasty Communist and didn't like having well raised children. permalink RolandDelacroix 2 points 28 minutes ago It's almost always the friends pouring poison in her ears. permalink MegoThor 3 points 35 minutes ago Husband was the master of taking out trash the whole time. Wife just didn’t realize. permalink okboomer59 1 points 9 minutes ago Dude probably had undiagnosed ADHD permalink Choomguy 10 points 4 hours ago Good forthe kid, but that seems a little steep permalink UncleSlayton 15 points 2 hours ago $5 today = $1 in 2000 permalink okboomer59 1 points 6 minutes ago used to get $5 for each quarter acre lot I mowed (rural Midwest, the '70s) $25 today? permalink NoFalseSong 10 points 3 hours ago The eternal boomer permalink The_Return_of_User_x 9 points 2 hours ago He doesn't have insurance either! Gasp!! permalink Bobf 6 points 2 hours ago What are you doing living in a house if you cant afford 5 dollars for VIP trash bin service. permalink Stlpoolguy 2 points 54 minutes ago I gave my neighbor kid $20 for the same service while we were on vacation. Didn't seem too bad permalink DJTJ2024 9 points 3 hours ago Ugh, just another subscription service to deal with! What happens if I forget to cancel? Will he still take out my garbage when he's 35? permalink bill_in_texas 11 points 1 hour ago Hi, this is Columbi1a House records. We note in our files that you still need to purchase two records from us to fulfill your contractual agreement to buy 10 albums from us, in exchange for your initial purchase of 13 albums for 1 cent. Thank you for your attention to this matter. permalink MarshallB 4 points 3 hours ago How many days a week do you get a pickup? I get it one day a week now after twice a week for decades (and before wheels on garbage cans or luggage) permalink SanityGumby 1 points 21 minutes ago I'd pay for it. I forget to do this far too many weeks. permalink okboomer59 1 points 4 minutes ago take an ADHD assessment permalink Maxmax 1 points 47 minutes ago What a great service he is providing. permalink RolandDelacroix 1 points 29 minutes ago That's pricey but worth it, I've forgotten too many times. permalink okboomer59 1 points 2 minutes ago I forgot to take out the trash so many Tuesdays before school that it became my permanent task once I got the paper route the routine became easier permalink Obsessedcowpuss -2 points 45 minutes ago OK, but what about the Ep t in coverup? Why is the Administration working so hard on hiding the files? If they are fake, as the President asserted, what is the harm in releasing them? permalink 381 Raise your kids right. 🔥🗑️ ️ GARBAGE PEOPLE 🗑️🔥 posted 5 hours ago by blue5707 23 comments suzy @Suzy_1776 • 14h We have a seven year old entrepreneur in our neighborhood.
