CA leftist officials keep shuffling the votes around until they get a result they like. It is a rats' nest of thieving demons who all must be changed out---or, and this is the case--eliminated altogether once we have in place quantum voting from personal phones/computers. It's coming soon. ~ 21 Aug 2025 permalink permissible_missile 18 points 4 hours ago quantum voting Apex cringe permalink Meister_Bockmist 11 points 3 hours ago Listen, Jack, I order my quantum pizza from my quantum phone, and i get my Schr√∂dinger's with extra cheese and a cat in the box. permalink westrock2000 4 points 2 hours ago The news told me it is debunked conspiracy theory that people are eating cat pizzas. permalink Side_o_beef_curtains 7 points 4 hours ago Can confirm. I grew up in California. It is common for districts to have 125% of registered voters cast a ballot on election night in areas that are not as far left. permalink NotYourMan 6 points 2 hours ago Once democrats conquered the state of California, they changed the voting laws to favor cheating. This is the last step and that step involves no voter ID, ballot box stuffing, ballot harvesting. Its always the same with democrats after they conquer a city or state. permalink yuio4344 6 points 4 hours ago The CIA, FBI and the other 16 Intel Agencies protected Epstein' / M0ssad / lsraeIi government's Congressional extortion child f*ck honeypot for over 20 years.

Disabled, military, overseas? Too bad. permalink FuckU/Spez 14 points 4 hours ago Almost every country has a consulate or embassy. Go vote there in person. That's what other countries do. I don't trust the disabled vote.

I need to be able to mail it! we've seen that US postal workers now go through ballots and dump the ones from opponents. when you put it in ANY mail, even US mail, you're destroying chain of custody. permalink glow-operator-2-0 3 points 2 hours ago Union soldiers were trained / shipped to their registered counties to vote in 1864. It can be done then, it can certainly be done now. Sounds like a lack of will to me. permalink thisisatestof2 1 points 46 minutes ago Excellent point. In terms of the military vote, no reason you can‚Äôt set up some on base voting system. permalink Svaap 0 points 2 hours ago You mean campaign flyers?

I didn't open mine since I planned to vote in person, so they said my vote would take 2 weeks or so to be counted. permalink DCPower 5 points 2 hours ago Please support Mike Lindell of MyPillow to fight for election integrity!

And yet basically everywhere they've been adopted the counting process is slower and more prone to error. permalink MarshallB 4 points 50 minutes ago We're from the Government and we're here to help. But we're also private so you can't audit our systemic stealing. permalink Kwdzr 3 points 49 minutes ago The real reason is so they can cook the books in real time. Counties send off their numbers so the lib areas know how much to pad their count. permalink UltraMAGAMilton 5 points 3 hours ago The moment Gavin said he was going to let the people decide, you knew he was saying, hes about to manufacture consensus for the optics. That's what democracy is. Now he can run around and say, "Hey, the people voted for this, Im just doing what the people want" ;) . . . permalink glow-operator-2-0 2 points 2 hours ago People voted for Prop 13 in 1978 and against a later Prop 5 (2020s) that would undo Prop 13.

There's literally no where in the entire world where people vote to raise their own taxes except for California. This is how you know they cheat. permalink Txiribiton 3 points 5 hours ago ...and about the FBI, DoJ, NSA, etc. It tells you all you need to know about the country. permalink johnfist2 2 points 2 hours ago The fact that in the recall, Newsome got more support than he did for his election, tells you all you need to know. You don't get a recall done, and somehow have MORE support than when you started. That's just not how it works. permalink DCPower 2 points 2 hours ago Please support Mike Lindell of MyPillow to fight for election integrity!
