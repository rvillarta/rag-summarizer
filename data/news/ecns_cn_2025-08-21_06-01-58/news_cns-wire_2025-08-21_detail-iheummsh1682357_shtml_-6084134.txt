Mao introduced that Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited India from August 18 to 20 upon invitation where he met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, held talks with Minister of External Affairs S. Jaishankar and together with India's National Security Adviser Shri Ajit Doval co-chaired the 24th Round of Talks Between the Special Representatives of China and India on the Boundary Question. During Wang's visit, the two sides agreed on resuming dialogue mechanisms in various fields, deepening mutually beneficial cooperation, upholding multilateralism, jointly dealing with global challenges and opposing unilateral bullying acts. On the boundary question, the two sides reached new common understandings, agreeing to conduct normalized management and control, maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas, properly address areas of sensitivity, and initiate boundary negotiations in areas where conditions are met. Chinese Foreign Minister noted that in October last year, President Xi Jinping had a successful meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Kazan, enabling a reset and fresh start of China-India relations. The two sides have since earnestly implemented the important common understandings reached between the two leaders and taken the bilateral relationship into a new process of improvement and development. This did not come easy and needs to be cherished. As each other's neighbors and two major developing countries, China and India share similar philosophies and extensive common interests. There is all the more reason for the two countries to trust and support each other. The current circumstances further highlight the strategic significance of China-India relations and the strategic value of bilateral cooperation. "The Indian side noted that India and China are partners, not adversaries, and that a stable, cooperative and forward-looking relationship between India and China is in the mutual interest of the two countries. The two sides need to enhance communication, deepen mutual understanding, and expand cooperation to demonstrate the immense potential and bright prospects of India-China cooperation to the world," Mao said.
