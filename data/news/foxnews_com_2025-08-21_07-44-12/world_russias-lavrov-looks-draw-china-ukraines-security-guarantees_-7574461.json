    "article_summary": "Russia seeks to involve China in negotiations with Ukraine, with Moscow proposing security guarantees for Ukraine that would include China, the U.S., Britain, and France. Ukraine has expressed reservations about this proposal, fearing it would give Russia and possibly China too much influence over its future security. China, while not a party to the Ukraine crisis, has expressed support for \"fair and objective\" peace talks and is ready to play a constructive role in resolving the crisis.</s>"
