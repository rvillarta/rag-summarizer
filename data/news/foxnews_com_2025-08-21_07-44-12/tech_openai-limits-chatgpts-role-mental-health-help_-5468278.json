    "article_summary": "OpenAI has introduced new safety measures for ChatGPT to address concerns about its responses to mental health-related queries, aiming to prevent over-reliance and reduce the risk of harmful or misleading responses. The changes include prompting users to take breaks during long conversations, avoiding offering specific advice on personal issues, and developing tools to better detect signs of mental or emotional distress. OpenAI is also partnering with mental health experts to refine these safeguards further.</s>"
