(Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson) Meta AI policy allowed chatbots to flirt with kids According to internal "GenAI: Content Risk Standards," Meta's legal, policy, and engineering teams signed off on chatbot rules that made it acceptable for bots to describe a child as "a youthful form of art" or engage in romantic roleplay with minors. Even worse, the guidelines gave room for chatbots to demean people by race and spread false medical claims. This was not a bug. These were approved rules until Meta faced questions. Once Reuters started asking, the company quickly scrubbed the offensive sections and claimed it had been a mistake. META ADDS TEEN SAFETY FEATURES TO INSTAGRAM, FACEBOOK We reached out to Meta, and a spokesperson provided this statement to CyberGuy: "We have clear policies on what kind of responses AI characters can offer, and those policies prohibit content that sexualizes children and sexualized role play between adults and minors. Separate from the policies, there are hundreds of examples, notes, and annotations that reflect teams grappling with different hypothetical scenarios. The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed." Meta told CyberGuy that their AI policies prohibit content that sexualizes children. (Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson) Big Tech puts profit over kids' safety Let's call this what it is. Meta didn't stop this on its own. It only acted when exposed. That shows Big Tech's priorities : money, engagement, and keeping kids glued to screens. Safety? Not even on the radar until someone blows the whistle. Meta has repeatedly shown it couldn't care less about your children's well-being. It's about maximizing time online, pulling in younger users, and monetizing every click. This latest scandal proves once again that parents cannot rely on tech companies to protect kids. Congress pushes Meta to explain disturbing AI rules Senator Josh Hawley and a bipartisan group in Congress are demanding that Meta come clean . Lawmakers want to know how and why these policies ever got approval. Hawley called on Meta to release all internal documents and explain why chatbots were allowed to simulate flirting with children. Meta insists it has "fixed" the problem, but critics argue these corrections only came after they were exposed. Until real regulations arrive, parents are on their own. A bipartisan group of lawmakers are demanding that Meta release internal documents and explain why chatbots were allowed to simulate flirting with children. (Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson) META FACES BACKLASH OVER AI POLICY THAT LETS BOTS HAVE 'SENSUAL' CONVERSATIONS WITH KIDS How parents can protect kids from risky AI chatbots While Congress investigates, families need to take immediate steps to protect their children from the dangers exposed in Meta's AI scandal. 1) No unsupervised access to AI chatbots Children should never have free access to AI chatbots, including Meta AI. The internal documents show these systems can cross boundaries that no parent would approve of. Supervision is the first line of defense. 2) Turn on parental controls across all devices Enable parental controls on phones, tablets, and computers. These tools give you more visibility and limit access to risky apps where inappropriate chatbot conversations could happen. 3) Talk with kids regularly about AI and online dangers The Meta revelations prove AI can go places parents would never expect. Ongoing conversations with your children about what is safe and what is not online are essential for their protection. 4) Use content filtering tools to block risky apps Apps like Bark allow parents to block or filter certain programs where AI interactions may slip through. With tech companies failing to self-police, filtering tools give parents more control. Read more here: Is your child’s data up for grabs? The hidden dangers of school tech 5) Install strong antivirus software on every family device While antivirus software won't stop AI flirting, it adds a much-needed layer of security. Hackers and bad actors often target kids through the same devices where chatbots live, so whole-family protection matters. The best way to safeguard from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing you and your family's private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.

META AI’S NEW CHATBOT RAISES PRIVACY ALARMS What this means for you If you thought chatbots were harmless fun, think again. Meta's own documents prove its AI bots were allowed to cross dangerous lines with children. Parents must now take a proactive role in monitoring tech, because Big Tech will not protect your kids until forced. Kurt's key takeaways Meta's scandal shows once again why blind trust in Silicon Valley is dangerous. AI can be powerful, but without accountability, it becomes a threat. Congress may push for answers, but parents must stay one step ahead to safeguard their children.
