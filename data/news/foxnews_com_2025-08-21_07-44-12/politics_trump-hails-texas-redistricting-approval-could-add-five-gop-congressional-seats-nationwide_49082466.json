    "article_summary": "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and President Donald Trump celebrate the approval of a redistricting plan in Texas, which could add up to five new GOP-leaning congressional seats. Trump urges other Republican-led states to follow Texas' lead, claiming it will strengthen the GOP's hold on Congress and potentially secure 100 additional seats nationwide. Democrats, however, view this as the beginning of a legal battle, accusing the GOP of diluting minority voting power and engaging in a racist power grab.</s>"
