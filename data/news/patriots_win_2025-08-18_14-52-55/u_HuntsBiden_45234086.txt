permalinkcontextall comments (41)America is the Greatest Country In the World (and don't allow fools to tell you differently)HuntsBiden 3 points5 days agoYeah, we already went over how you beclowned yourself with the "Proper English that sentence would be" self-own. I'm going to pass on taking advice from you on English or what constitutes as special needs. There's simply no hope for you, faggot. Good bye.
permalinkcontextall comments (41)America is the Greatest Country In the World (and don't allow fools to tell you differently)HuntsBiden 4 points5 days agoNo such rule! It is both grammatically correct AND widely used
But don't let me stop you from sounding like a complete retard grasping at straws, go for it! You've ALREADY conceded you sound like a retard, so embrace it!
permalinkcontextall comments (41)America is the Greatest Country In the World (and don't allow fools to tell you differently)HuntsBiden 4 points5 days ago{Proper English that sentence would be: "Sounds good, faggot. You keep pursuing that dream."
Maybe you don't have high enough IQ to qualify for doing that. Probably something to do with inhaling feces on the regular.}
"Proper English that sentence would be..." lol what a self-own, you faggot.
The best you can do is criticize my lack of punctuation... on a smartphone.
But to do so, you craft an incoherent, structurally insufficient diarrhea of the mouth.
In English, you need something to connect "Proper English" to the rest of the sentence. "In proper English, that sentence would be..." or "The proper English version of that sentence would be..."
Instead, you're just a cunt.
Follow me for more tips on "proper English" you faggot!

permalinkcontextall comments (41)deletedHuntsBiden 7 points5 days agoIt's interesting that earlier you claimed seeing race and religion as a division is foolish, and then you divided by race and religion in this post.

permalinkcontextall comments (41)America is the Greatest Country In the World (and don't allow fools to tell you differently)HuntsBiden 5 points6 days agoPerformative contradiction
You started out moralizing "muh colorblindness" and calling anyone who sees race as a division a fool.
And then you rely on race as a meaningful category to highlight high rates of poverty and incarceration among the blacks.
Logically inconsistent, just like you.
permalinkcontextall comments (41)America is the Greatest Country In the World (and don't allow fools to tell you differently)HuntsBiden 4 points6 days agoYou know we all can see when you edit your comment, so the fact that you had to go edit your comments twice after I pointed out how utterly retarded you are to write ""I was never harassed, threatened, or attacked. The few times I was harassed and threaten" and then call me a retard for pointing out how retarded it is to say "I never was and the the few times I was" makes you sound of supremely niggardly intelligence
