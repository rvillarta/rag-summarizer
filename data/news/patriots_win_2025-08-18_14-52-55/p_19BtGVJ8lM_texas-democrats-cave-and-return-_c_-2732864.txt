permalinkClassygasoline 34 points3 hours agoTypical big talk from Republicans, no action
permalinkIkon 14 points3 hours agoLiterally, every single time.
permalinkCalMagaMan 4 points2 hours agoIf my parents acted this way I would have never listened to them.
permalinkSpindle-spin 4 points2 hours agoThey said they were going to charge them in two weeks. Just hang on tight
permalinkTheSonOfGadsden 8 points3 hours agoYup, just another reason why I’ll stay registered as an Independent
permalinkdrattastic1 0 points2 hours agoThat's a mistake, register republican and you can vote in republican primaries and help weed out the RINOs. Most states won't allow nonpartisan primaries, maybe your state does but regardless you still need to vote in them, that's what allows these weak ass compromised republicans in office is us sitting the primaries out.
permalinkmovetofirefox 6 points2 hours agoThey can't bring criminal charges because it's not a crime. It's a summons, which if they comply with nobody is going to arrest them.
permalinkbarwhack 6 points2 hours agoIt was a felony warrant.
EDIT: I was wrong. The felony threat was for fraud, and Abbott never advanced that bit.
permalinkmovetofirefox 1 points29 minutes agoUnder what code? You don't have a source.
permalinkbarwhack 1 points8 minutes agoNot a felony warrant evidently. A civil warrant that extended to the SAA and the TX DPS, and not out of state at all. Based only on the TX House Rules Book; so not even fully statutory. It stood up under TX supreme court scrutiny in 2021, though.
I stand corrected.
permalinkdrattastic1 4 points2 hours agoBet if the roles were reversed democrats would find a way to arrest them and make it stick.
permalinkAVeryNakedMan 3 points2 hours agoTypically an "arrest" of a member of the legislature just involves forcibly bringing them into the building to allow the vote to legally take place. The arresting officer doesn't actually put them in jail.
permalinktrumpORbust 2 points2 hours agoAnd a total waste of time and resources, what did they think would happen... RINOs just fold and give up?
Oh, yeah -- that's what they do
permalinkwarlord30 1 points2 hours agothat's because they came back u retard

that's because they came back u retard
Warrants were issued, not threatened. Arrests subsequent to a felony* warrant, are INDEED arrests for actual crime. They were permitted to make it in, unarrested, implying a favor shôn upon their crappy beings, that I-retard assess as undeserved.
I am glad someone of your intellectual caliber was around to clue me in.
permalinkshogun5000 43 points3 hours agoZero consequences
permalinkOutlawPurpleHairDye 24 points3 hours agoEveryone knows you can always walk off your job for 2 weeks and come back like nothing happened.
permalinkDoritalos 4 points2 hours agoThey did get fined $500 a day, let's see if they actually are forced to pay it.
permalinkCheesemaker 1 points2 hours agoDude, they were probably given more than $500 in free alcohol during their vacation.
permalinkdonteatthat 27 points3 hours agoSo arrests? Yeah didn't fucking think so.
Theater
permalinkCrlsniper 4 points2 hours agoForget arrests, those were always just up bring them back to work and nothing else. I want them removed from office for dereliction of duty
permalinkTheSonOfGadsden 3 points3 hours agoJust theater and grandstanding
permalinkMythArcana 15 points3 hours agoLet's get back to that 15 seat plan since Newsom plans to destroy every red district in California. We have to go nuclear if we want to or not.
permalinkBadfinz_FL 11 points3 hours ago9 seat Texas.  just do it.
permalinkimnotdeadyet 3 points3 hours agoThat's the one the Senate approved.  Not sure it will get thru the RINO House.
permalinkitspancakees 6 points3 hours agoThey should all be arrested and jailed indefinitely unless they resign from office

permalinkUpwardBound 3 points2 hours agoForce them all to give up the Beto-payments and cough up their travel expenses personally.
permalinkDocBrody 3 points2 hours agoand the fucks still get paid, no matter what, right?
Two weeks vacation from their vacation job.
permalinkEdgyUsernamexX69Xx 3 points2 hours agoI’m sure ridiculous bullshit has been going on in the intervening days while this circus occupied everyone. These stunts the political class keeps hitting us with are getting really insulting
permalinkChoppermagic 3 points2 hours agoVacate their seats.  There has to be punishment or they will do it again.
permalinkGodKingHarambe 2 points2 hours agoAnd none of these brazen, lawless faggots will be arrested
permalinkEvilGuy 2 points2 hours agoThe Dems get to pretend they are fighting for the people and the Republicans get to pretend they are tough and mean business.
No one lost their seat, no one got arrested for bribes or whatever they were talking about as I and many others predicted 2 weeks ago.
The loser here is the people who have to fund every part of this nonsense against their will.
permalinkDestroyerofCobwebs 2 points1 hour agoArrest them and keep them under arrest until the 2nd special session is complete.  My guess is they're planning on coming back just long enough to cause all the court cases to die off, then they'll abscond again.
permalink13MMshooter 2 points3 hours agoNever was any doubt.
permalinkHamilton_Miller 1 points1 hour agoI wonder how much Jerry Mandering had to do with this decision.
permalinkYouAreIgnorant 1 points1 hour agoSee. All talk all the time.
Does not matter which party.
permalinkgrenades_and_ham 1 points7 minutes ago“Nothing will come of it.”  ✅
permalinkDev404 1 points2 hours agoArrest those seditious bastards.
permalinkDonsabai 1 points1 hour agoIt's no victory without 9-10 new R seats. Anything less is RINOs working hard to kill any wins.
permalinkhamajun 1 points2 hours agoI'd suggest to arrest them and keep them in the ICE detention center near the Southern border in TX.
permalinkspezisacuckold 1 points3 hours agoARREST THEM
