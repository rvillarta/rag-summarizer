I can‚Äôt stand the faggot, but he knows how to work the Twitter crowd.
permalinktry4gain 36 points3 hours agoTrump is the best thing that ever happened to leftist content creators
permalinklixa 11 points2 hours agoAnd the worst thing to happen to the Left. People are tired of the humorless, ever-offended group and don't want to be part of that.
permalinklotxe777 2 points2 hours agoall twitter spammers love it. we're in one right now.
permalinkaltYPNeT 1 points2 hours ago"content creators"
permalinkSlugbert 9 points3 hours agoI blocked both of them long ago. I refuse to give either of them an ounce of engagement.
permalinkDT170x 4 points3 hours agoI don't block people. I want to hear their BS.
permalinkMAGABOND 6 points3 hours agoIt‚Äôs the only thing this faggot is known for.
permalinkairborne3502 4 points3 hours ago"Creating engagements to pay his bills" is the smartest thing I've read on here in a while regarding social media influencers.

President Trump to Zelensky on canceling elections: "So you say during the war, you can't have elections? Let me just say. 3.5 years from now [when Trump leaves office], if we're in a war with somebody, no more elections? Oh...that's good! "I wonder what the fake news will say."

permalinkMAGABOND 2 points3 hours agoYeah no spin there, eh shitenstien?
permalinkBlackPilledMAGA 31 points3 hours agoThey will bash Trump for even suggesting it while they support Zelensky for actually doing it.
Zero logic, zero consistency except when it comes to attacking Trump on everything. That's all they ever do.
permalinkPsarg 6 points2 hours agoThey're saying whatever gives them the best outcome.  They're using brilliant logic to craft their deception and it's 100% consistent. Everyday Democrats screaming in street protests are the only lost ones.
permalinkStolenElectionsKill 19 points3 hours agoTrump is such a Master Troll.  He knows how to fuck with these people better than anyone, even when it goes right over their heads.
permalinkBlackFolk 3 points2 hours agoJust imagine how much literally anyone under 40 who is MAGA could be trolling and lighting the Dems /uniparty on fire if he were in power.
permalinkThePatriotGames2016 12 points3 hours agoThey're so tone deaf
permalinkGrilledpepe 10 points3 hours agoImagine making it this far into trump taking over politics and still falling for shit that only takes 5 seconds of context to prove false.
permalinkPeaceMakerDJT 9 points3 hours agoAfter all these yrs, they still haven't caught up with his trolling
permalinkShlomoJoe 8 points3 hours agoPersonally, I think it‚Äôs a good idea to cancel them. Not for a war but due to the millions of illegals likely voting in our elections. We need to guarantee the integrity of our elections before we can hold them again.
permalinkSomebody157 6 points3 hours agoTrump is the best Troll of all time.
permalinkTheSonOfGadsden 4 points3 hours agoKrassenstein is a retarded fag
permalinkridge3z 3 points3 hours agoProgs are so deranged that they actually believe Trump wants a third term. The don't even realize that we are mocking them and their derangement syndrome.
Just mock progs further by saying that their man Zelenskyy put the idea in Trump's mind.

permalinkhamajun 2 points2 hours agoI wish I could bait fishes this easy. I know fishes are smarter than libtards and I am sorry if I offended fishing sportmen here.
permalinkthisisatestof2 2 points3 hours agoHaha‚Ä¶. I can‚Äôt believe that idiot still falls through the trap every time, yet, liberal worship him.üòÇ
permalinkJohnCawktoastin 2 points3 hours agoNice new "suit". Still sits like a 8 month pregnant sow.
permalinkDoritalos 2 points3 hours agoIt doesn't matter, because liberals always exempt themselves from the rules they put on other people.
They are incapable of processing hypocrisy.
I can list a dozen examples, including things like Gavin's, et al. covid lock downs. They don't care, and I'm not sure "independent" voters do too.
permalinkAmericanLaborLover 1 points3 hours agoComment removed by community moderators.permalinkthecave888 1 points2 hours agoThey are so dumb. Trump has so much fun getting them going.
permalinkMatterThatMetals 1 points2 hours agoToo funny. Trump is a master troller.
permalinkCyanScales 1 points2 hours agoIf it's good enough for Zelensky. . .
permalinkRedPillosopher1776 1 points40 minutes agoI wouldn't support a third Trump term, hes getting too old and needs to relax so we can have him around as long as possible.
I want someone much meaner than Trump in 2028, hell what I really want is an American hitler who'll say fuck your corrupted institutions and laws, someone who do the bane thing "buh buh the law says..." "and you think this has power over me?"
I want a holocaust of the left and invaders, I want four years of the entire diseased temple being brought down on their fucking heads,  I want arrests tribunals and public executions.
permalinkTophat9000 1 points4 minutes agoContext is everything... Why say this during this meeting?... Because Zelensky did cancel elections sighting the war... It's something many want to forget or ignore.....so Trump doesn't say it directly.. but indirectly and guess what people talks about it now in the context of comparing it to Zelensky and it puts pressure on Zelensky to be   more "flexible"
permalinkatomisten 1 points2 hours agoit's not even possible to cancel elections in usa due to war since it's written word by word how to proceed in elections during times of war/crises.
permalink45ForEver2024 1 points21 minutes agoDem grifters are getting rich off this.
permalinkiIndianaJones 1 points3 hours agoThese two butthurt twins blocked me long ago.  They are absolutely clowns and life losers.
permalinkBoomCannon 1 points2 hours agoThe Krassenstein fags are paid shills.  NGL, Brian is probably jealous of Zelensky's height.
permalinkKernalMustard 1 points49 minutes agoWhos paying them.
permalinkRerun1Central 1 points2 hours agoTrump is BRILLIANT
permalinkSquentin 1 points36 minutes agoI love that he does this.  He is trying to teach his critics to think more critically, but they mostly never learn the lesson.  It would be a better country if they did.
permalinkiamimaginos 1 points2 hours agoGot him to wear a suit, didnt he?
permalinkYodaBannon 1 points2 hours agoPlot twist, Trump will be a major voice and influence during the Vance Era, making appearances and busting balls YUGELY üá∫üá∏
permalinkShaffro 1 points34 minutes agoIf Trump was a dictator Brian the asshole would be gone .
permalinkjosiborg 1 points2 hours agoThis was a perfectly executed double jab to excite leftist and call out Zelensky for being a dictator.
permalinkFuckU/Spez 1 points1 hour agokRASSENSTEIN  and his brother alone are keeping the Depends adult diaper industry afloat, not even those adults pretending to be babies buy as much as these cucks do.
permalinkPorkchop-express 1 points2 hours agoI wouldn‚Äôt mind canceling the 2028 if we at war with Mexico. Start droning the cartels and boom we at war
permalinkKernalMustard 1 points48 minutes agoThe cartel is the government
permalinkconservativefrank 1 points2 hours agoLeftist cancels elections - SEND THEM BILLIONS
Right winger jokes about cancelling elections - TYRANT REEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!
permalinkN3G4T1V3 1 points2 hours agoAll leftists are retards, it's a spectrum from slightly retarded to drooling knuckledragging barely sentient unwashed degenerate imbeciles.
permalinkMAGAnical_Bull 1 points2 hours agoI'll be writing in Donald Trump in 2028 so it's not a joke.
