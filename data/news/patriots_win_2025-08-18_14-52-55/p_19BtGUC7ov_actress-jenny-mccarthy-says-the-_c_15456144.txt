I was so wrong. Much respect to JM for being one of the first to speak out and refusing to be silenced.
permalinkLuckycoz 47 points6 hours agoThere were a lot like us.  Looking back, I wish I could've slapped younger me for thinking she and Tom Cruise were insane.  Fortunately, I was smart enough to be dumb enough to not go vote in those early years.
permalinkKricket 37 points6 hours agoWell then you’ve got one-up on me. I voted for Obama… twice.
I’m happy to report a full recovery tho.
permalinkHikingPatriot 28 points6 hours agoObama fooled a lot of us. Especially if you're Gen X. We were all pretty hopeful that the racism against black people days were over bc now we the US had elected a black POTUS.
Little did we know his plans to reignite race wars...
I didn't vote for him but that's bc I didn't vote at all that year due to illness. By the time the next election came around I had figured him out and voted accordingly.
permalinkdr_gonzo 26 points6 hours agoHey now, I'm Gen X and I knew exactly who Obama was long before he became president. I was warning people about him after his infamous speech at the 2004 DNC.
And I was far from the only one. Hell, even if you were just one of El Rushbo's 20 million listeners you knew. That's what the whole "I hope he fails" fiasco was all about, and Rush explained that about a million times. He was saying he hoped Obama failed to impose those intentionally destructive Neo-Marxist tactics. Basically, "if Obama succeeds then the country fails".  Of course he was right. Anyone that was familiar with post-war Neo-Marxism knew he was right when he said it.
I refuse to be lumped in with the people who were acting like Obama's presidency meant racism was over in the U.S. Those people made me apoplectic at the time. To this day I have no fucking idea how so many people fell for that ungodly simplistic "Hope & Change" idiocy. It was so fucking transparent.
But I'm glad some like you finally came around, don't get me wrong.

permalinktw0scoops 9 points5 hours agoTo be fair, McCain was a piece of shit too
permalinkview 2 more comments...try4gain 4 points5 hours agoEven hard core Republicans go fooled.  The media full court press on the fancy N was unreal.
permalinkdrattastic1 3 points4 hours agoI'm gen X and could smell obama's bullshit a mile away but I bought into the neocon's bullshit for a little while especially after 9/11 but eventually 9/11 also woke me up from their lies as well. Trump really awakened millions of us totally from the uniparty.
permalinkyou_know_GOAT 10 points6 hours agoI was brainwashed till Trump won in 2016. I had to question why. Found this place shortly afterward. Holy Hell. All these Frens saved my Life.
permalinkJerryNadlerBeltFund 1 points3 hours agoI had to two-step upgrade to my own BS detector.
The first was after "the Lightbringer's" dull DNC speech that the MSM couldn't stop gushing over.   HE sounded like another grifter, promising big ideas but nothing realistic.  I had been listening to Rush for a couple years, so I developed healthy skeptecism by then.
The second step didn't happen until the 2016 election cycle, when it the concept of RINO and Uniparty finally registered.   Watching Republicans call candidate Trump unqualified, an extremist, naiive, and stupid was enough to break my Fox News programming and see how dirty both sides of the aisle are.
permalinkt-bone 5 points6 hours agoRaises hand….guilty here too.
But recovered as well!
permalinkGoldwaterVoter 5 points6 hours agoWOW! Are you still shaking from the shock upon learning that Obama was in on the Russia-Russia coup? I walked neighborhoods registering voters for Goldwater in 1964, voted for Reagan 4 times, volunteered for the Trump campaign in September 2015, worked at many Trump rallies, etc., so it is hard for me to imagine your situation!
permalinkKricket 3 points6 hours agoI’ve been on the train since right after Bernie let BLM lunatics take a mic from him on-stage and Trump told similar lunatics to get the hell out at his event. Was politically homeless before that. Obama lost me when he started pushing wage gap nonsense (“your math is bad”) as well as the college rape epidemic hoax.
So no, not particularly shocked. The last 12 years or so have been plenty of time to adjust to the notion.
permalinkview 1 more comments...Gotmygoose 4 points5 hours agoI voted for him 2008, but saw he campaigned from the center but governed from the left. Obama is the Deceiver in Chief.
permalinkDagneyTaggart 9 points6 hours ago100% agree with you and chewsoap. I was  fooled and foolish.
permalinkGarbageLivesMatter 7 points6 hours agoShe was right and many of us were wrong.
permalinkGarbageLivesMatter 6 points6 hours agoI think that Lisa Bonet (The Cosby's) was also one of them but Big Pharma silenced them all.  Cruise just keeps to himself and McCarthy disappeared.
Big Pharma cannot turn a profit with healthy people so they do it through vaccines.
I suspect it is the first vaccine after birth (Hep B) that does them in.
permalinkOppenheimer_DOW 6 points5 hours agoOver 90% of them should never be administered at all but some like hep b are probably worse.
Getting multiple at the same time is like playing Russian roulette with your child.
permalinkGarbageLivesMatter 4 points4 hours agoDo any doctors know what is in a vial?  Sure there is a label but do they know what they are administering?  A few bad batches and Big Pharma will have clients for life.

permalinkdatraceman 5 points5 hours agoTom Cruise is insane but even a blind squirrel finds a nut every now and then.
permalinkminttea2 1 points9 minutes agohttps://vocaroo.com/1bcLWLeZFAdr - AI Tom Cruise thinks Top Gun is great and gay
permalinkGrilledpepe 10 points6 hours agoLesson to never stop learning.  Many liberals I know used to be very smart back in the day then thought they knew everything and stopped learning new shit.  They are now completely retarded.  Its a good thing when you allow yourself to grow.
permalinkSteelBallRun1890 4 points6 hours agoIt's the hubris. And with many also dunning-kruger. Lot of young kids graduate high school with a few AP classes done and hate Trump thinking they are the smartest shit cause the school constantly validates them through wacky teachers.
permalinkAVeryNakedMan 5 points4 hours ago
I remember thinking she was a nutjob for this.
The media told you to think this.
permalinkUSDMaga 4 points4 hours agoI thought she was dumb too, so I decided to look into it.
Vaccine history has been a complete shit show from the beginning.  They have killed thousands upon thousands and then hid their murders and ridiculed anyone who pointed it out.  Back in the polio vaccine days.
McCarthy I thought was slightly overboard, but she had science and facts on her side from the beginning and the opposition had name calling.
permalinkIAmTheScience 3 points5 hours agoWait until history looks back on anti-depressants that make you kill yourself and anti-psychotics that make you go psycho.
Just as retarded. Actually more.
permalinkChoppermagic 38 points6 hours agoI remember when everyone was making fun of her for talking about vaccines.  Big Pharma is nasty
permalinkecto_coolest 12 points5 hours agoPlenty of retard maskers out there that would still make fun of her I’m sure
permalinkfreebirdie 4 points4 hours agoNot everyone. I was one of the ones ridiculed. People on our side called me all sorts of vile names. To date, only one has apologized, and that was u/Klown_Kutz here on this forum.
permalinkKlown_Kutz 3 points3 hours agoYou and everyone who has tried to warn us.  And I meant it.

permalinkglow-operator-2-0 6 points6 hours agoJenny was hot, but mediocre hot IMO
I was more into Erika Eleniak.
permalinkFerzth 1 points57 minutes agoShe was definitely smoking hot, back in the day, a favorite.  Sad and disappointing to see how she's physically turned out . . . we all get old sometime, but those tats . . .
permalinkthelastlast 13 points6 hours agothe heavy implication being that the govt and pharma work w each other
permalinkdatraceman 12 points5 hours agoI mean they clearly do. Look at COVID. That was all a mass marketed worldwide fear panic of Big Pharma and world governments. It's scary because that showed how easy it could turn into a true globalist hierarchy. Made me vote way different moving forward even locally. Anyone concerned with globalism as a goal automatically gets a no vote from me because that's one step toward worldwide totalitarianism.
permalinkzooty 4 points5 hours agoHealth is a fantastic lever for parting people from their money.
Once you start with that premise, you can build everything about where we are now from there.
permalinkglasscrawler 3 points4 hours agoMoney, and reason too.
permalinkPrandogolio 6 points5 hours agoI think we're past the "implication" phase.
permalinkMAGAnic316 3 points2 hours agoNot just pharma, but the mass media as well. MSM mockingbirds, publicists, ad agencies etc.
A lot of people shared Jenny’s experience, but their voices were simply ignored due to government’s monopoly’s/stranglehold on information back then. It’s no wonder most normies assumed she was a nut.
That type of shit doesn’t fly with today’s internet - where she’d post about a vaccine injury and have thousands of people coming forth to agree with her in just a few hours. Hence all the faggoty new online “safety” laws and censorship bullshit. As if we’ll all just go back to magically trusting big pharma and big government again because “this video has been removed due to Muh terms of service”. That’s going to have the OPPOSITE effect if you ask me.
Fuck pharma, I will never trust them or use one of their products ever again. I haven’t even so much as taken an aspirin since 2021. Keeping my kids the fuck away from them as well.
permalinkTrumpAndGodWin 2 points1 hour agoI remember them demonizing aspirin during covid to get the death numbers up from blood clots etc.
permalinkfreebirdie 1 points4 hours agoSince USAID got the axe, every single Rite Aid around me has closed. Coincidence?
permalinkHikingPatriot 12 points6 hours agoI remember this. I remember we all thought she was all woo woo tree hugging and over reacting about vaccines.
Boy were we wrong. Jenny McCarthy stood up and told the truth when absolutely nobody else would. She was the beginning of opening eyes to vaccines but it took decades for the truth to become obvious to us all.
permalinkBeelzy 5 points5 hours agoAt least some people listened to her. I had no such luck.
permalinkN14205ST205 4 points4 hours agoI feel awful for drinking the Jenny McCarthy haterade as a kid. I only knew about access to the MSM news and pop culture, so I assumed that she was off her rocker.
COVID didn't just show me how wrong I was, it showed me how the vaccine chicanery was worse than she claimed. That period was a big wake up call for me on multiple fronts.
I came out of that saga with a newfound understanding of the importance of standing up for what's right and speaking out against what's wrong, even if it means  standing alone. Now, I respect her tremendously for taking a stand for what's right for its own sake and refusing to be bullied into silence.
permalinkPrandogolio 2 points5 hours agoWe all?  Who is "we?"
permalinkHikingPatriot 2 points5 hours agome and my people
permalinkPrandogolio 3 points4 hours agoOh you hikers...
permalinkFerzth 1 points59 minutes agoWhat do you mean "you people!"
permalinkfreebirdie 1 points4 hours agoNot all of us. I was trying to tell people, but all I had were online forums, wherein I was roundly scorned and insulted.
permalinkPillarOfWisdom 10 points6 hours agoThat's impossible...it's not like the gov't has (((friends))) who have full control of the media and news.

permalinkfreebirdie 4 points4 hours agoActually I think it's between 65-90 different products now, if I'm remembering RFK Jr correctly.
permalinkTrumpAndGodWin 2 points1 hour agoAnd before RFK Jr cases of autism were projected to go to 1 in 5 kids in not many years from now, it used to be 1 in 50,000, then 1 in 34 now.
permalinkbleeje 8 points6 hours agoSo many dimensions to this.
Which government agency was this? Under which govt cabinet dept does it fall? Who funds it?
What is its purpose? Where is it HQ'ed or centered?
What is the CDC, FDA, NIH involvement in this?
Who signed off on the funding for this PR agency?
Is this an established strategy? Looks like it is. Who decides when to deploy it?
Is this decision made intra-governmentally or externally?
permalinkSpawnlingman 8 points5 hours agoWe stopped shopping at several places that went crazy during covid with commie rules.   We still don't shop there.  We left them behind.  I was kicked out of Chipotle 2 times for not wearing a mask. lol
permalinkMc_TheDonald_OG 4 points5 hours agoSame. Still won't go back
permalinkRoadpower 6 points6 hours agoWow, it's 2025 and we are still being forced to bleep out "vaccine"? WTF.
permalinkPrandogolio 4 points5 hours agoNo, not forced.  The right has just been cuckedly conditioned to self-censor.
permalinkTrumpAndGodWin 1 points1 hour agoI was watching a YouTube asmongold video about Roblox and their pedos, they censored an unbelievable amount of words, even in text from news articles.

The Covid scamdemic was used to steal the election.
I want the end of the Democratic Party, and the RINO quislings within the GOP, before Trump's term ends.
permalinkRealHappyFeet 3 points5 hours agoOur tax dollars paid for her smear campaign too...
permalinkSavingPrivateGrace 3 points6 hours agoSame.  I remember the big pharma made a smear campaign against Purebloods after the Covid vax injuries were fresh.  We went to our daughter's to save her racing heart.  Too scared to trust the hospitals that were outright murdering people rather then admit they were having reactions to the vax, we made numerous phone calls to doctors we knew, personal friends of doctors and doctors we didn't know.  I finally had all the information and I pretended to be a doctor speaking to a doctor in order to get a prescription for a Beta blocker, as her heart rate was racing in tachycardia.  2 hours of phone calls and relaxation meditation, as long as no one panicked, we had a prescription to pick up.  She was back to a normal rate within 10 minutes.  It was only from previous past history of a hereditary thyroid disease known as Hashimoto's disease that we recognized the symptoms and what we needed.  A lot of people have underlining thyroid conditions, especially children where thyroid enzymes and lack of go unrecognized until they are given a vaccine that that disrupts the hormone imbalances of the heart's regulations, like the someone turned off the electricity, or sped it up in her case.  Well again, I'm not a doctor, I've seen the response first hand.  I told her to go on Reddit and post the experience so others can learn from it and not have to go through what we went through.  Her post was taken down almost immediately.  It's important to keep reminding people that Purebloods did do all that they could to save people, just as this mother/actress tried.
permalinkThePatriotGames2016 3 points3 hours agoStill fucking hot
permalinkBetterNameUnfound 3 points4 hours agoI wish I'd known YEARS ago that THAT was the reason she became so anti-vax.
Gee, who would have a vested interest in me not knowing that...
permalinkecto_coolest 3 points5 hours agoI wish that she was my mommy

permalinkShinAkuma -3 points5 hours agoAnd she folded like a cheap lawn chair.
permalinkRusherOfDin -5 points6 hours agoJenny McCarthy was going nuts about vaccines long before mRNA vaccines ever existed. There are good vaccines in use regardless of what you all think and we can't dismiss the entire medical technology because some greedy fuckers used their AI created lipid nano particles to cut corners.
permalinkBerettaStroker 16 points6 hours agoProve it. Prove there are "good vaccines" that do more good than harm.
ZERO of the 72 vaccines on the children's schedule have placebo-controlled safety trial data. The CDC was sued for the data and couldn't produce it.
ZERO.
permalinkTheTelltaleFly 8 points6 hours agoBeretta gets it.
People (especially doctors) believe in vaccines like a religion. I remember being taught in school books that vaccines were safe and effective and great. They start the brainwashing young. Most people never question any of it until they are personally injured.
permalinkPowerOfBlues 1 points5 hours agoI don't think I've ever met a doctor who wasn't a smug asshole
permalinkLiberty49220 3 points4 hours agoI can't prove it, but I can think critically and will continue taking a tetanus shot every 7 years.  I have sheep and cows.  I've seen them die with lockjaw.  No way do I want to go through that.
permalinklionwind 1 points5 hours agoYou seriously don't think the polio vaccine did more good than harm?
permalinkBerettaStroker 4 points4 hours agoNope, sure don't. Go read the book "Disolving Illusions" by Suzanne Humphries. They have lied to you from the very beginning about all vaccines.
permalinkFatigueIsReal 1 points4 hours ago1918 flu.  Smallpox. Polio.  Tetanus.
There you go.  Good vaccines.
permalinkBerettaStroker 3 points4 hours agoNo, none of them are "good."
All lies and obfuscation from the beginning for the exact same fucking thing they lied to people about 100 yeare ago.
MONEY.
permalinkFatigueIsReal 1 points4 hours agoEverything has a cost.  To always use money as a proof for foul play is retarded.
A good example is Polio - "The polio vaccine was developed with the goal of widespread distribution, and Dr. Jonas Salk famously refused to patent his invention, prioritizing public health over personal profit."
permalinkview 1 more comments...zooty 2 points5 hours agoI think when people have questions, the correct response is to provide answers, not slander them in the media.
I, too thought the anti-vaxers (pre-covid) were a bit nutty but it seems there concerns were not being properly addressed.
permalinkFatigueIsReal -1 points4 hours agoThe reason you thought they were a bit nutty is because they are.
They don't apply critical thinking or much thought at all to vaccines and medicine other than "Vaccine bad."
Its the same mentality as anti-Trump.  Covid exonerated their insane claims and RFK is cleaning it up by analyzing what is good and bad.
permalinkzooty 3 points4 hours agoThere are questions related to their childrens' health and 'you're nutty' is not a satisfactory response.
RFK (or an analog) is what was needed but we are getting RFK in 2025 and not in 2005 (or earlier) like we should have.
