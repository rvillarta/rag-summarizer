permalinkForceMultiplier 1 points2 hours agoI imagine the moped might be returned if they can find an owner

permalinkNY2KCMO1776 2 points2 hours agoIt felt so good to get a Missouri id and walk into a oawn shop and buy 2 guns.  I first walked in with my NYS Dl and he laughed at me and said he couldn't show me anything.
I carry all the time now, shoot at the range, have 4 guns in total.  No more unconstitutional background checks by the NYPD, no more being a target.
You gotta leave.  There is life outside of NY.  Im flying back on Wednesday just to spend 7 days out on the island at Montauk, Fire island, RM and Long Beach.  Do some quick shopping in the city and fly back to Kansas, to freedom.

permalinkWarViper1337 2 points4 hours agoProtip: if you happen see a moped approaching you (especially if it has two dudes on it) then that is a universal sign to get ready for action because they aren't there to make friends with you.
permalinkbrassmule 2 points5 hours agoIt's nice to see moped riding scumbags getting shot dead by off-duty cops in America finally, instead of having to resort to 3rd World countries to satiate that demand.

permalinkUSMC6541E5 1 points4 hours agoRan his arm tattoo through AI......
The image displays Chinese characters tattooed on an arm. The characters are identified as 媳 (xí) and 自強 (zì qiáng).
媳 (xí):
This character primarily means "daughter-in-law" or "wife" from the husband's family's perspective.
自強 (zì qiáng):
This phrase means "to strive for self-improvement" or "to strive to become stronger".
When combined, the meaning of the tattoo could be interpreted as "a wife who strives for self-improvement" or "a strong, independent woman".
