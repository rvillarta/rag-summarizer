permalinkbleeje 77 points5 hours agoAt least he looks suitably miserable.

permalinkPlease_Clap 13 points4 hours agoHe could wear a thong with goofy Smiley T-Shirt for all I care as long as the war is ended.

permalinkview 1 more comments...NomadicKrow2 4 points54 minutes agoI'm thinking about dropping my practice and going back to welding. I'm thinking this because of the reconstruction contracts in Ukraine that will open up. There's a lot of money to be made - Might as well be an American, rather than some fucking jeet or subsaharan.
permalinkview 1 more comments...General_Grievance 7 points4 hours agoHe's mourning the death of the country he supposedly leads.

permalinkKekistanPM 21 points4 hours agoHe's dressed like a high school student who never wore a suit before going to prom.
permalinkgunteh 11 points4 hours agoHe‚Äôs dressed like a teenager who was told to dress up and reluctantly did a bare minimum while trying to assert ‚Äúhis independence‚Äù.
permalinkMR__K 6 points4 hours agoHe's a comedian first. Leader second. At least he put something on. He doesn't know that as the leader of Ukraine he disrespects himself and his own people first by looking like that though.
But ya better than nothing
permalinktoobaditworks 6 points3 hours agoHe's playing the role of a poor whittle boy whose country is fight'n the big bad ebal man.
It's the John fedderman scam and anyone in Hollyweird. They are rich as heck but go out in public (after calling up some photographers to follow them around) dressed as hobo's to try to get their fans to believe 'he's one of us'.
permalinkItsFunToSay-M-A-G-A 4 points3 hours agoIn his mind, he thinks he's Johnny Cash. But in reality, time after time, he's been more like Johnny Paycheck.

permalinkredredwine 5 points3 hours agoSad man wants shekeIs.
Tasty is the money in someone else's treasury.
permalinkSouth_Florida_Guy 38 points5 hours agoHe literally looks like a little kid playing dress up with whatever he could find in his dad's closet or at the thrift store
permalinkNADSAQ 20 points4 hours agohe looks like a cokehead in a miami nightclub
permalinkGoldenEarz 9 points4 hours agoHe‚Äôs literally an actor playing the role of a president?
permalinkgrenades_and_ham 1 points18 seconds agoWhat I said, he borrowed each piece from his buddies.
Joey, can I borrow your jacket?
Louie: Hey, I got some pants that almost match that jacket.
Jimbo: You can use my work shirt, I‚Äôm off tonight.
permalinkDickTick PRO 13 points4 hours agoThe worst part is that it's very obviously not even fitted to him, so the president of Ukraine couldn't even be bothered to throw together a tailored suit for the biggest meeting in his entire life so far......
permalinkGTHAYS 6 points4 hours agoGotta put gas in the Bugatti.

permalinkBarrysOFace 5 points4 hours agoHe wore a tshirt and a beanie to the whitehouse
permalinkpermissible_missile 5 points4 hours agoHe wasn't begging.
permalinkStolenElectionsKill 2 points3 hours agoWell tbf, that is his 'costume' online.  Even sportsball people wear their jerseys to the WH pretty often.
permalinkSaltiTaralli 1 points18 minutes agoDo you think he takes it off if he has sex... with himself I mean.
permalinkKumalasbreakfast99 35 points5 hours agoYou can't turn shit into ice cream.
permalinkNamendaBiden 12 points4 hours agoNo, but i turn ice cream into shit pretty often.
permalinkCreepy_Joe 6 points4 hours agoBill Gates can do that. He already made "I Can't Believe It's Butt Butter!"
permalinkclownworld30330 3 points4 hours agoYou can, if you pay the person who had to eat it enough.
permalinksod_off_shotgun 29 points5 hours agoYeah that's an approximation, but how hard is it to just put on a fucking suit to keep more children from dying?
permalinkElencher 17 points4 hours agoHe's a jew, he's actively trying to get white christian kids killed, that's part of their plan.
permalinkTrumpAndGodWin 1 points1 hour agoThe synagogue of satan.
permalinkCT2099 22 points5 hours agoLol!  Guess he got the memo and changed once he arrived
permalinkDeplora 11 points4 hours agoThis is what he was wearing when he arrived at the White House today.  There was a fake clickbait post from a random enegagement farming X account that claimed he showed up in a T-shirt, and showed a video clip from a meeting he participated in at the Ukrainian Embassy.
permalinkSALTYinSeattle 22 points5 hours agoDressed up just enough to keep Dad from grabbing a belt
permalinkRetard_Strength 20 points4 hours agoyea, anyone with kids recognizes this as the teenager doing the whole 'malicious interpretation of your directions' passive-aggressive bullshit.
permalinkStolenElectionsKill 3 points3 hours agoAbsolutely.  What a petulant little child.
permalinkspez_this 18 points4 hours agoWearing his Temu John Wick costume a little early.
permalink11GenAm 13 points4 hours agoNope, no tie.  I commented elsewhere that I couldn't tell if there was also a black tie with a black shirt and a black jacket.  And no, the jacket doesn't match the pants, so it's not officially a suit.
Jerk.
permalinkStolenElectionsKill 4 points3 hours agoYeah I noticed that too.  He can't even wear matching pants and jacket.  Are his lifters brown, too?
permalinkNADSAQ 3 points4 hours agolooks like cotton; not a suit
permalinkSaltiTaralli 1 points15 minutes agoIt's not a suit jacket or even a blazer. It's an overcoat of sorts, look at the snaps.  Unless in Ukraine they consider this sort of thing to be a dress casual "blazer".
Anyone know what kind of shoes this turd wore?
permalinkEdBuck 11 points4 hours agoThis is completely fine. It's a suit, not one id wear but it's a suit.
permalinkDeplora 7 points4 hours agoPresident Trump signalled his approval when he greeted Zelensky.  If it's good enough for President Trump, it's good enough for me.
permalinkAnyone 10 points4 hours agoMillions in stolen aid from the US and this joker can't afford a suit?  Fuck him and the ukraine.
permalinkGTHAYS 6 points4 hours agoPresident TRUMP's tie cost more than that fucker's entire suit.
permalinkyurimodin 4 points3 hours agoBILLIONS
permalinkBarrysOFace 9 points5 hours agoHe stole it from a midget strip club bouncer...
permalinkmastermeatlock 5 points4 hours agoIs the bouncer a midget or are the strippers midgets?
I've seen a midget beat the shit out of a guy once.  First punch was straight to the nuts and when he keeled over, uppercut.  Normal sized dude was down and midget just stood over him raining punches.  It was hilarious.
permalinkravonaf 7 points4 hours agoThe "suit" is a compromise. Which is exactly what he has to do, even if he doesn't like it. There is no scenario in existence that Ukraine can actually outright win this war. The globalists have milked the United States for all they can possibly get at this point. The tit is dry. It's time for this war to end. Besides, they always have a backup war ready to go. This one will end, and the next one will start shortly.
permalinkSavingPrivateGrace 6 points5 hours agoSloppy short bus rider.
permalinkIAmDisappoint 6 points4 hours agoPiece of shit faggot, eat shit and die in a fire.
permalinkMythArcana 6 points5 hours agoIs the server melting down in the back room or something? Everything is soooooo slooooooow today. I might get to see this image in another 20 minutes at this rate.
Ahh, there it is. Yep, no tie. Send them all back. You had your chance, pal. Tell Vlad to expect a care package soon.
permalinkTrumpAndGodWin 2 points1 hour agoIt wouldn't surprise me if the Deep State scans (etc) our devices here to see who they can use for false flags and all that.
permalinkDeplora 1 points5 hours agoI'm not having any issues with the site.  Must be on your end.
permalinkMythArcana 2 points4 hours agoThat's strange since this is the only site giving me issues right now. Checked my service speed, everything fine there. Images take 5 minutes to display here.
permalinkDeplora 3 points4 hours agoMaybe try closing the window and then re-opening PDW in a new window.
permalinkFecklessgod 5 points4 hours agoMaybe Tucker Carlson can lend him one of his old bow ties.
permalinkReturningtogod 5 points2 hours agoIt would be hilarious if Monica Crowley handed him a tie and made him put it on as a condition to entering the White House. Like at fine restaurants.
permalinkProf_Smith 5 points4 hours agoI love the idea that the European leaders dressed him like this kid going to a wedding.
permalinkyurimodin 1 points3 hours agoü§£
permalinkgunteh 5 points4 hours agoThis is the way a bratty child would dress up after being told to dress up for the occasion. Hes absolutely capable so he has no excuse now.
permalinkActNow 3 points1 hour agoThat makes it even worse. He has a wardrobe, but is being petulant.
permalinkPederella 5 points5 hours agoHe kept the jacket the waiter loaned him at lunch.
permalinkspinometer2 4 points2 hours agoTrump can read his petty microaggressions like a book
permalinksourkraut 4 points4 hours agoWhat is his shitty problem? We know from the past as he can dress respectably; Why does he not do it?
First, it is an insult to any American to show up for a state visit dressed so shabbily.
And secondly, one also demands from the Ukrainian soldiers that they keep their hygiene and uniforms in order - despite shelling, bombing and everything.
How do you want to justify these principles to these people if the commander-in-chief runs around like the last bum?
permalinkbluedevilga 3 points4 hours agoLooks like he got it in one of the homeless camp discount sales

permalinkIm_RickSteves_bitch 2 points4 hours agoWith all the money we‚Äôre being extorted into giving him, you‚Äôd think he‚Äôd get a suit that fits.

permalinkJohnCawktoastin 2 points4 hours agoOh the outfit. I thought maybe there was a "You must be this tall" sign out front.
F'n midget.
permalinkHanrahan 2 points4 hours agoAll black? I hope Trump doesn't trip over him.
permalinkmass55th 2 points2 hours agoDid he go to the Good Will store before he hit the White House? Couldn't even afford a tie. What a turd.

permalinksoup13 2 points4 hours agoThe peace making war? Because there's no other war to win. Ukraine wouldn't stand a chance even if the US resumed and doubled military aid
permalinkTrumpAndGodWin 1 points1 hour agoRussia is out producing them 3 to 1 in weapons even with their outside help from other European dictators in the EU.
permalinkChimpanzeeFatigue 2 points4 hours agoGuess it‚Äôs hard to wear a suit and dress like a man when all you want is to wear a dress
permalinkTrump-16-20-24-28-32 2 points4 hours agoSeems OK to me.  It's not like he has nipples protruding (very disrespectful!).
permalinkGhostOfMyFormerSelf 2 points4 hours agoSent this asshole $500,000,000 and he can't even hit up Men's Warehouse before his meeting?
permalinkRandyQuaidsBeard 1 points12 minutes agoFuck this midget bitch. He know full well what a real suit is as he had no problem wearing one for Claus Swhab at WEF. This is him being a petulant little man-child. Couldn't even be bothered with a tie let alone matching coat and trousers. Honestly I'd have sent him packing to mens warehouse or go home.
permalinkEIEIO 1 points47 minutes agoTrump should gift him a proper suit.
permalinkJesusisKing 1 points4 hours agoMuch better but why at that point he doesn't have a formal military uniform?
permalinkliberpede 2 points3 hours agoThat would be traditional for a military dictator who cancels elections and arrests dissident journalists...
permalinkSuperUser 1 points28 minutes agoWould be funny if he wore the exact same suit Trump was wearing.
permalinkDCYR66 1 points2 hours agoHe stopped raiding Fetterman‚Äôs closet.

permalinkstargunner 1 points1 hour agoi wish for this faggot to never step foot on american soil again
permalinkPatriotSkorzeny 1 points4 hours agoHilldawg giving fashion advice?
permalinkShadow-Band 1 points1 hour agoNot a suit, and His refusal to wear one shows the contempt he has for America. I'm down to just 50/50 split this clowns country with Russia and be done with it.

permalinkgrandfather_nurgle 1 points4 hours agokek he actually wore a suit rofl
Glad to have adults in charge again.
permalinkChrisquiet 1 points2 hours agoCan't even wear a tie. POS actor wannabe dictator.
permalinkRationalThought 1 points2 hours agoZellystein will never relinquish power, never and it's not up to him at this point anyways.
permalinkTGNX 1 points4 hours agoIt's not terrible. Could use a tie with some color to bring it together though.
permalinkDrTar 1 points1 hour agoIf he was crossing Abbey Road, he'd be the one that's bare foot.
permalinkDeplora 1 points5 hours agoThanks for the clear close-up.  I couldn't tell from the video footage if he had a black tie on too.  Oh well, President Trump indicated approval, so it's good enough for me.
permalinkPillarOfWisdom 1 points3 hours agoIt looks like he pealed it off of a piss-stained hobo.
permalinkFatigueIsReal 0 points4 hours agoYou can tell the amount of boomers on this site when tie or no tie deserves a sticky.
ü§£ü§£ü§£
permalinkStolenElectionsKill 2 points3 hours agoYou can tell the naive youngsters around here, who don't know how to dress, or just petulantly refuse to dress for formal, and serious occasions like this. I know it hurts the children's fee fees to hear this, but people really do judge you by how you dress and present yourself.
Just like I told my wife's teenage daughter 20 years ago, "If you dress like a whore, people will treat you like a whore."  She was deeply offended by this statement, and never got over it and always hated me for saying it.  She didn't listen, kept dressing like a whore, and was dead less than 10 years later.
Zelensky will be treated like he's dressed, just like she was.  It's human nature.
permalinkFatigueIsReal -1 points3 hours agoDressing like a whore as a young lady is monumentally different than not wearing a tie.
That's a comparison only a smug boomer would make.
"My wife's daughter" is also a massive tell.  You shouldn't have married a woman with kids if you can't claim them as your own.  Also something boomers are famous for.
