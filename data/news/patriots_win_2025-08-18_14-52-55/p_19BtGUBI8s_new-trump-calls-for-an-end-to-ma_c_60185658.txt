Sure, that could easily be undone by the next POTUS but it's a start and could really lead to some more popcorn from the Democrats because they're going to lose their shit over this. It'll go to court, etc.
permalinkhellohellohellohell 92 points9 hours agoWith mail-in balloting gone there may never be another President elected who wants to remove it...
permalinkdrattastic1 55 points9 hours agoExactly my thoughts, if democrats can't cheat they can't win a national election.
permalinkDrWeeGee 21 points8 hours agoRINOs in power aren't much better
permalinkglow-operator-2-0 11 points8 hours agoOne problem at a time.
You can always step up and take over your local county or township.
permalinkview 2 more comments...StaticNoise2 6 points7 hours agoRINO's are RINO's because the Democrats are the ones with power, so there's incentive for weasels to secretly join their gay little club while pretending to be conservative to the people they're supposed to be representing.
If you take the power away from the Democrats, you won't have RINO's as the incentive and perks is gone.
They'll still be weasels, but if the incentive becomes to serve the American people instead of globalists, then they can be weasels all they want as long as they, regardless of their motivation, serve the people and the nation.
If their motivation is ultimately self serving, but it aligns with traditional America, it's not an issue.
You'll never get weasels out of politics, but you can make some behaviors so un-worth pursuing because the risk outweighs the benefits that it keeps the worst things at bay.

RINOs in power aren't much better
Right, and electronic voting machines that leave no paper trail are actually worse than paper ballots.
Just like with most promised "reforms," We the People stand to lose either way.
As they say in Italy, "Things must change so they can stay the same."
permalinkDrBJTester 1 points1 hour agoWe need to DEFUND RINOs next or better simultaneously and return to a representative republic that focuses on the will of the people tempered with wisdom. Instead of what's the most financially beneficial for the corrupt ruling class on both sides of the isle. As GETOUS sets the stage MAGA!!
permalinksola_scriptura 1 points4 hours agoWe need to bring down Murkowski, and any remaining cancerous artifacts of the Romney-Bush-Cheney-McCain camps. Graham. McConnell. All of them. They've consistently chosen their big donors over their constituents, at great cost to us. You don't hate them enough.
permalinkHunter77 6 points6 hours agoIt's anecdotal, but I really think people in this site underestimate the number of Dem voters in this country, probably due to echo chamber effect. My experience has been different - Dem family, Dem coworkers, and living in a county that's roughly split (which seems accurate to me, based on people I've met).
I think if normies vote Dem - which they will if they're unhappy with the economy - Dems can still win. Normies swing elections and vote stupidly.
permalinkmaverick202 2 points4 hours agoYou're absolutely right. This narrative that dems could not win without cheating is cope from losers. While there are shenanigans in elections, most of their victories are legit because people voted for them. The copers here can't explain why they stole 2020 from Trump but let him win 2024 if the fraud is as deep as they claim.
permalinkArea82 2 points4 hours agoI am as worried about states like Colorado, California, etc.  Get rid of mail in voting there and you probably have Colorado go red and California purple instead of two hardcore rat states.

Article I, Section 4, Clause 1:
The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.
permalinkSteve56775 4 points8 hours agoThis will stop Trumps order and the useless Rinos will never prevent the Democrats from using cheat by mail and ballot harvesting. Elections in this country, unless they are landslide victories, are over.
permalinktry4gain 3 points6 hours ago
"Manner of holding Elections"
does that mean 'manner of casting a vote'
permalinkBraineack 2 points5 hours agoDunno.  Clearly Congress can pass the law and the courts couldn't say otherwise -- but we'll never see that day.

permalinkcrackerstacker 2 points7 hours agoI'm pretty sure he can't do that by EO. Isn't it very clearly stated in the Constitution that the states run their own elections?
permalinkRock 52 points9 hours agoMail in ballots have been a thing. But the democrats weaponized it and count for days and weeks after. Also ballot harvesting and straight up fraud. So because of their actions, it has to go. Early voting if you have a problem.
permalinkrebuildingMyself 32 points9 hours agoNothing wrong with the absentee mail in ballot. You have to be eligible and put in the paperwork to request it. It's the only way people living overseas can vote (still subjected to US taxes btw).
The Democrat version spams unaccountable ballots in every mailbox and then makes sure there's a million ways for them to put their thumb on the scale weeks, even months, after the election. Basically, they want to make it easier for the least educated and least motivated to vote and cancel out voters who can plan ahead and care enough to vote.
Its clear the Uniparty is not tricking enough people to stay in their lane and must cheat to cling to power.
permalinkTrain_w_no_brakes 13 points7 hours agoThe exceptions need to be AIR TIGHT or else it’ll just be exploited again.
permalinkMeatsuit 1 points5 hours agoRemote ballots are inherently corrupt
permalinkgunzby 3 points7 hours agoI do recall a poster here that was in the process of getting their citizenship saying that they had gotten three different ballots of three different names in their mailbox. None of the names were theirs, lived there, or had lived there. This was in the summer of 2020
permalinkjusticein2020 1 points56 minutes agomy uncle got 7 ballots last election.     he's been dead for a decade+

Ya know i don't think i'd like to be the inheritor of any other relatives.
I spent a lot of time trying to convince people he's dead.
and the rifleman magazine will never believe he's dead. that lifetime subscription has gone far past his lifetime.
permalinkAquamine-Amarine 4 points9 hours agoThe mail in ballots are definitely part of the problem. Get rid of them and only have about one week of early voting, no more than that.
permalinkSavingPrivateGrace 2 points8 hours agoYes, and instead of calling it early voting call it Election Week instead of one day of Election Day have it over 7 days.  No ballots counted anywhere after 11pm election night, Sates can report daily totals of votes.  Vote in person with Real ID so everyone has to prove citizenship because the Dems tried to cheat elections with illegals.
permalinkFroynlavenfroynlaven 3 points7 hours agoNo reporting at all until all votes are counted.
permalinkSavingPrivateGrace 2 points7 hours agoYes, and one official announcement of the results from the Governor of each State to Congress on Live TV would be nice.  No more fake news announcements of results.
permalinkview 1 more comments...Thedeadliestmau5 1 points4 hours agoAbsentee ballots were the first mail in ballots and were used only when necessary. Somebody somewhere got the brilliant idea that we can just use absentee ballots to cast votes for anyone for any reason. Then, when COVID hit, states were forced to switch to mail-in voting as their primary method for voting (in-person has always been the primary voting method up to this). This massive change occurred only months before the election. You can imagine why that caused many issues as it changed the entire logistics of the voting and vote processing network
permalinkhere2red 25 points9 hours agoGood. Mail-in-balloting is not for people in the continental US. Its military officers stationed overseas and for our ambassadors and their people.
permalink5DchessWatch 22 points9 hours agoYou're conflating absentee ballots, which are SAFE and mail ins which are not.   Absentee ballots you request specifically from your election district and you have to be registered and all that, and they send you a ballot specifically to YOU with YOUR name already on it.  That's why its safe.
Mail ins are basically a brocure empty ballot that is sent to a bunch of people.  Sometimes like Trump said 3,4,5 ballots or more at one postal address.  Meaning that someone who got them could fill them out multiple times OR give them out to other people and they could fill them out with fake names.  People have filled out mail ins for their dogs for example.
Don't worry about absentees EXCEPT for a situation I was in, which is where I am SO rural that we don't even have USPS delivering.  They hired an independent contractor (a guy with a jeep and little yellow police light on top) to deliver mail.  This person swerves and drives like they are drunk or on meth.  They messed up the mail VERY FREQUENTLY.  My neighbor would get my mail, I'd get theirs.  Some important mails would go missing
One great example is an absentee ballot I requested because my designated polling place is over an impassable (no road, dead road) mountain, so I can get to it one of 2 ways and each way is at least 50 minutes away, each way.  I don't like driving an hour and 40 minutes just to vote.   But I ended up doing it when an absentee ballot was confirmed SENT but not received.  I tried to have USPS trace it, and they acted like they did not care.  I escalated to the USPS Postal Inspector General office and they would not even respect me enough to say they received my request, nor have they responded to follow up inquiries
The USPS messed up, and they won't be accountable for it, even 10+ yrs later
permalinkCharlieMike 9 points9 hours agoBelieve it or not, absentee ballots were not counted in some locations.  If they were mailed from overseas and arrived after the official Election Day, they would not be counted.  This was in part because it used to be considered a given the military vote was Republican.  If there were not enough absentee ballots to change the outcome, those ballots were not counted.
permalinkThedeadliestmau5 1 points4 hours agoI often wonder if the signature collectors out in the streets in the cities on election years are the ones collecting these signatures, registering people to an array of addresses that they reside over, and then using the signatures on the mail-in ballot. This would be possible since some states don’t require an ID or verified address to register.
permalinkPeaceMakerDJT 18 points9 hours agoID requirement, one day voting, end to mail-in, the democrats will never win an election again
permalinkShlomoJoe 3 points7 hours agoNo “Election Day” holiday bullshit either. You need to take the day off from work.

permalinktralbolh 8 points9 hours agoGood, for any saying this is a state matter, mail is Federal.

Oh but thank GOD we had voter ID. Did it make a dif? NOPE.
permalinkMaxineWaters4Prez 4 points8 hours agoHaving to put a system in place where the voter still has to leave their home to go to a designated place to cast a vote because they're not able to get to a polling place is so retarded only liberals could have dreamt it up.
There is only one reason they exist.
permalinkHikedelics 4 points7 hours agoTHIS could be his greatest achievement. If he pulls this off and secures out elections I could argue this is even more important than deporting the illegals. I’m skeptical that anything will actually come of this beyond social media posts and possibly E.O.s which aren’t as enforceable as we’d all like.
Securing our elections means that even if he isn’t able to get every last thing on our wish list accomplished, we still have a real shot at getting it in the future. Without trustworthy elections I fear we fall right back into the uniparty trap as soon as he’s gone and then before long it will be like he was never even here.

permalinkLight_HIV_Effect 2 points9 hours agoWe have inconsistent voting rules, same day registration, no picture id to vote in many places, mail in ballots, it takes weeks to count in some places (and just a few hours in places like Florida), and the longer it takes to count, the more likely it is the democrat wins.
permalinkblueeyephoto 2 points9 hours agohow long until there's another "deadly" virus that calls for quarantine over the election cycle so the Dems demand more mail in ballots?
permalink5DchessWatch 2 points4 hours agoThe US Federal government should FIRST start with DE-BUNDLING Federal and State elections on the same ballot
TWO ballots, NOT ONE
If it does that, then the fed gov only has to print 50 different ballots.   With only the President and US Federal level races for those states  (ex: Kentucky senator, NC reps)
Then they can use the military to run THEIR elections in a uniform way, and districts only matter in terms of tallying but not collecting.  So the military could have mobile units and set up in parking lots like walmart
And states can go and fuck themselves in as many ways as they want with their own damned elections.  Administered by ridiculous bespeckled old black democrat voting officials still wearing masks and derping around this way and that looking very much like they don' tknow what they are doing

permalinkDestroyerofCobwebs 1 points6 hours agoYet another case of Selective Feminism at work.  One of the most obvious reasons not to have mail in ballots is because of voter coercion.  The sort that can happen inside of an abusive marriage.
Easily a case where the feminist movement should have stood up for women and demanded at the very least, mail in voting should be opt-in, and doing so should have to be done at the county election office, in person, every election.
That would provide some level of protection against shitbag husbands forcing their wives to vote how they want.
Instead, not a peep from them.  Because it doesn't align with their political interests.
