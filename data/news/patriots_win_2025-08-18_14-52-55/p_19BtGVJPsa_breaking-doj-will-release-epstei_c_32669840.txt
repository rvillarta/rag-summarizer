permalinkWtf_socialismreally 3 points2 hours agoMoving the whole field there at this point.
permalinkNeo2025 3 points1 hour ago....The down votes are probably coming because your reply to the proceeding comment made it seem as though you though his sentiment was serious....
....And what people need to make a point about, is that while Epstein might have been used by US intelligence (in addition to being used by Israeli intelligence) that's a situation we can no longer rectify.
However, we should damn well make sure our intelligence agencies don't abuse children for intelligence gains ANYMORE.
And that is why there needs to be some answers regarding Epstein.
permalinkMkultraUSA 1 points2 hours agothank you
permalinkWhoopies_tds 1 points1 hour agoThey're like Antifa
permalinkSea_Still 54 points2 hours agoAnything they release now will be fabricated horseshit
permalinkFatigueIsReal 20 points2 hours agoAnything they released on Day 1 of Trump's presidency could have been fabricated horseshit.
Anything they released the day he was arrested could have been fabricated horseshit.
Everyone has their own timeline for when they think they're being lied to.
The important thing to realize is that you were never going to see the unaltered evidence.
permalinkmonkadelic 3 points41 minutes agoNo way, we decided as a group that media reporting on this one specific topic was spot on, and therefore a physical list exists, and has all your hopes and dreams on it.
permalinkAmerica_No_1 1 points32 minutes agoAnd it comes in a nice clean binder to be dispersed to...twitter influences.  Much better than raids and arrests.
permalinkmonkadelic 1 points12 minutes agoFun Fact: Those binder were put together by Epstein himself, in the secret safe of evidence he kept.  Pam Bondi just relabeled them.
permalinkTrumpForPresident 1 points21 minutes agoThe truth is that no one may ever know the truth.
permalinkRationalThought 12 points2 hours agoBiBi flight coming to DC in 3...2...
permalinkBrez 3 points1 hour agoDon't be surprised if it's not much of anything. The sum total of these gathered facts led to only the 2 people you know of charged in like 2 decades of this being in the public radar. Either the facts aren't there, or they just didn't look for the facts. The last thing I'd expect is some very detailed proof of anything. The most substantial thing to expect might be victim interviews and statements with some crazy shit, and some kind of "justification" to why the investigation didn't go further based on these statements.
permalinkImClearlyLost 2 points56 minutes agoI agree with you but that‚Äôs the reason I want to see this stuff. We should be able to scrutinize the investigation, or the lack of investigation.
permalinkbumpman 3 points54 minutes agoNo shit Sherlock..
You think they‚Äôre gonna go through the trouble of killing Epstein but leave a client list??
Some of y‚Äôall don‚Äôt understand how cover ups work

(because they will still vote for Zoran Mandani over Trump)
permalink37dwarves 4 points1 hour agoHe owes them for letting him win.
permalinkbumpman 2 points51 minutes agoVegas let‚Äôs hardcore violent criminals go everyday on bail, but somehow trump did this?
This is a blue city problem not a conspiracy
permalinkFatigueIsReal -2 points2 hours agoThese comments are my favorite. They're all over reddit anytime anything at all happens.
Its always a distraction for whatever thing the commenter just became aware of.
permalinkmonkadelic 1 points38 minutes agowell at least in this thread there isn't 17 people going "cool, now what about epstien".  As though we aren't capable of more than one issue.
permalinkFatigueIsReal 1 points34 minutes agoGive it time.  Haha.

permalinkOhioRepublic 19 points2 hours ago"We're still talking about that guy?"
permalinkTookens 19 points2 hours agoYou can bet your life that they won't be releasing the good stuff.
permalinkmyke 5 points2 hours ago...describe, in vague terms, what you mean by 'the good stuff.'
permalinkTookens 8 points2 hours agoIdentifying records, grand jury testimony, classified information..
permalinkbumpman 3 points45 minutes agoYour theory is:
The deepstate or whoever is skilled and powerful enough to kill Epstein and frame it as suicide, but they‚Äôre dumb enough to leave the ‚Äúgood stuff‚Äù in a file and hand it over to Trump administration?
That would be a weird way of doing a coverup.
permalinkTookens 1 points36 minutes agoI literally never said that.  Epstein killed himself.
permalinkTrumpForPresident 1 points15 minutes agoWhy do you think any information from that time is credible if it comes from the same people who killed the guy and covered it up?

permalinkmyke 4 points2 hours ago27 all-black pages and a laughing emoji. Interesting...
permalinkKlaus73 2 points2 hours agoOr it will be the lunch orders of the folk on the oversight comitee.
Again I hate to say it but I think the whole "the deep state" thing has gone to becoming a meme.
Basically if its good its Trump; if its bad its clearly the deep state - essentially offering a divine excuse for any bad outcome.
this reminds me of the unedited Epstien video...
permalinkKlown_Kutz 7 points2 hours agoWhat files?  Fox News Host oops I mean AG Pam Bondi said there weren't any.
permalinkZennbrown 6 points2 hours agoHuffPost?

permalinkingrowntoenail 4 points2 hours agoWhy wait until Friday?  Tick Tock...
permalinkTheRedPilledArtist 5 points2 hours agoBecause then they can run out the clock Friday, do the bare minimum, do nothing all weekend, and move on by Monday as everyone's already talking about something else by then.
permalinkmyke 3 points2 hours agoThat's plan A. Four and a half, roughly, days between then and now - plenty of opportunity for life to happen.

permalinkKernalMustard 1 points1 hour agoIf this is true. I'm done. This is the one thing I ever wanted from Trump. To defeat the DS and drain the Swamp. If there isnt evidence you can use tell us. Tell us so we can move the fuck on.
permalinkmonkadelic 2 points35 minutes agoIn fairness, he tried to.  Now its stupid fucking snarky comments like "are we still taking about this guy?"
permalinkgrenades_and_ham 1 points9 minutes ago‚ÄúAre you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein?‚Äù
permalinkHallelujah_Jesus 1 points26 minutes agoyawn, and then what?  The committee will lock them up until they can "review" them, and we'll still never see them.  Uniparty in action!

permalinkMAGA_NRG 1 points2 hours agoSpread out over 3 1/2 years
permalinknoPTSDforMePlease 1 points2 hours agoIt's pretty impressive how, by saying he wouldn't release these files, he got the entirety of the Democrats to call for  their release. Now they can't ignore them if they implicate Democrats.
I think trump is mentioned in the files, but my guess is that he never did anything criminal nor disgusting.
The fall out is going to be pretty wide reaching. My guess is several famous celebrities and rich civilians, and minor politicians will end up being charged. I don't think the clintons or other high ranking politicians will be charged.
We will see.
permalinkMoonlight 1 points23 minutes agoA list is not enough. What we need is an Epstein member investigation for all eyes to see. This is the hill to die on! Screw a pedotopia.
