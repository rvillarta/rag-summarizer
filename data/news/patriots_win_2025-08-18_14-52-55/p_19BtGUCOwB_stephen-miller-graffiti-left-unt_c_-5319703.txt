permalinksola_scriptura 6 points3 hours agoSingapore has the correct solution to public vandalism like this:
Corporal punishment. Cane strikes in the public square.
When the older niggas show the younger niggas their scars from cane strikes, there is a small chance those younger niggas may think "Damn, I don't want that to happen to me. Maybe I SHOULDN'T spraypaint public works."

permalinkLizardKingx002 3 points5 hours agoLmao and AR15s are banned in Chicago (have been for some time)

permalinkBurneraccountno4 4 points5 hours agoAs a kid I bought spray paint multiple times to paint bicycles and other projects. Never had a problem buying it from the local hardware stores. Never used it for graffiti either. Of course, this was when I lived in a 99% white town.

permalinkrebuildingMyself 6 points5 hours agoLike graffiti on your ear drums
permalinkCommanderOfCheese 2 points4 hours agoLike any other music -- or anything else, for that matter -- 90% of everything is crap.
The solution isn't "the entire genre is everywhere and always bad" but rather a combination of recognizing your personal taste AND curation.
There's good graffiti. It's usually commissioned by the person who owns the building (that is, it's paid for and wanted by the person who owns the building), not spontaneous and not a crime. It's just that 90%+ of it is unwanted and garbage.
There's decent rap. I can't account for your particular taste but I can agree that 90% of what I've heard is... not good. But then I can say the exact same of basically every other genre, as long as it's not filtered down by curation -- that is, go listen to random garage bands and their original songs, and you'll find most of it sucks.
permalinkvongregormench 2 points2 hours agoThe most notable and famous examples of rap are absolute garbage made without talent or thought. It‚Äôs absolute shit and there‚Äôs no comparison to anything else. It‚Äôs not even music.
permalinkCommanderOfCheese 1 points2 hours agoTom MacDonald would disagree.

Meditate on this line, boys and girls. Really consider it. Write it down if need be. Take a pic for your phone. Remember this line.
This man is one of the few leaders in the entirety of human history to give a flying ass about his society.
The reason why nations like India are in the state they are is because they don't have men like Stephen Miller in positions of power. If you want the US to lose control of its cities and towns, don't allow any more Stephen Millers.
permalinkLaptopDied 8 points5 hours agoTrue every word.
permalink37dwarves 1 points1 hour agoGood observation.
permalinkTrumpRINO 1 points5 hours agoComment removed upon the user being banned.permalinkCyanScales 24 points5 hours ago"Beautiful" graffiti is not graffiti.
If you need to rent construction equipment with the consent of the building owner, it's probably just art.
permalinkBadManOrange 17 points5 hours agoThere's a difference between an owner consenting and 99% of what your see otherwise.
permalinkCMDRConanAAnderson 12 points5 hours agoThe slippery slope is camouflaging graffiti by surrounding with similar "art" pieces. Making trash blend in is just as bad as allowing it. If art looks like the garbage in the alleys you're promoting the whole culture.
permalinkAppealToHeaven 7 points5 hours agoIn Barcelona, businesses were getting tagged so often, they actually commission graffiti "artists" to make a cool design instead of whatever garbage was tagged there before. I agree "Beautiful Graffiti" is not graffiti, and 99% of actual graffiti looks terrible. Its a tell of the culture with how prevalent it is.
permalinkCommanderOfCheese 8 points4 hours agoI think we may just be arguing word definitions. Graffiti is a style of art done on building faces with spray paint. And that can be beautiful. What's typically ugly is vandalism, the defacement of public property, and the two definitions often intersect.
permalinkBadManOrange 3 points5 hours agoI was in Rome and there were several businesses that I saw in the less touristy areas that had the shutter doors painted with a design for the business. That's cool, but it's the exception compared to everything else you see there.
permalinkSystemfree1632 4 points5 hours agoThe vast majority of graffiti in Rome is identical to DC depressing and illegible . Especially disappointing to see graffiti on beautiful buildings and hand built stone walls .
permalinkKotrin 2 points4 hours agoThat's a tax paid by locals in hopes to have a "controlled" disfigurement of their properties. Much akin to a mafia "insurance".
Neither work well, by the way.
permalinkzooty 1 points37 minutes agoThere's already a word for it: mural.
permalinkLizardKingx002 5 points5 hours agoThose are called murals lol
But people call the murals graffiti to legitimize graffiti
permalinkTheRedPilledArtist 4 points5 hours agoIn no way do I consider that "art."
It is simply vandalism.
permalinkBadManOrange 18 points5 hours agoIf you've ever been to Italy, the amount of graffiti destroying these ancient/medieval cities is preposterous. I think if you're caught and the owner didn't authorize you to do it, they should just cut your hand off as a punishment.
permalinkLizardKingx002 12 points5 hours agoIt's even destroying natural wonders. Shit bags graffiti sandstone bluffs
permalinkTNgirl4Trump 4 points5 hours agoI‚Äôm going to Rome & Florence in the spring and I dread seeing it.
permalinkstjimmy92 3 points4 hours agoIt wasn‚Äôt bad in Florence when I was there in 2016. It‚Äôs also my favorite city I‚Äôve ever been to so I hope you enjoy!
There was a Scottish pub in the central plaza outside the main cathedral, loved Americans and gave us a free round of shots because we knew all the words to All-Star by Smash Mouth
permalinkBadManOrange 4 points4 hours agoI had last been there in 2016 as well. IMO, Florence has gotten more smelly and dirty (of course, I think it's just generally worse in the summer). I still love the city though, but it's a shame to see what's been going on. I've discovered that it's definitely a city to visit more as a couple than as a family though.
permalinkPlantTrees 13 points5 hours agoWell said - graffiti is an attempt at marking territory, intimidation.  It is a destruction of property, lowers real estate values, declares disrespect, is ugly, presents an image of violence and chaos, causes cringe and angst for the regular people, brings the vibe down.
It is shameful seeing the decrepit America the dims/DS have wrought.  I'd like to see a nationwide clean-up and a major push nationwide to promote/teach people/children self control and respect including discouraging littering, living trashy, theft, property destruction and graffitti among other issues.
permalinkKotrin 2 points4 hours agoIt's advertisement for crime, plain and simple.
permalinkPlantTrees 1 points4 hours agoYes agree,  that is a good characterization.
permalinkPowerOfBlues -5 points5 hours agoActually graffiti is not nearly as widespread as it used to be...... lowlifes are less interested in marking territory in their local neighborhoods these days as they are in making a video that goes viral
permalinkPlantTrees 2 points4 hours agoI disagree, I see fresh tags all the time all over the country- even marring beautiful places like small towns, parks and remote states like Alaska . All over buildings everywhere [especially the back sides and on bridges, train cars, electrical stations, any flat surface]. Tags over tags ... whole cities are covered with it, and even as vandalism on some cars.
permalinkFriendly_B 11 points5 hours agoAs a public artist I applaud this measure.  I voted for this.
There's a brief sequence in the comic book The Sandman in which a few of the characters are walking through the collapse of Rome.
They're talking about the heights of Roman civilization but all we see are homeless people lying around and a man pissing on a marble government building wall.

permalinkCrappydatum 9 points5 hours agoIn my local town the graffiti is rampant. They took a particularly egregious bridge, invited the community and supplied paint and scaffolding. They did a Fantastic job, just beautiful. Then the punks decided to "tag" it. Bad idea. Let's just say they had no problem policing their own.
permalinkLaptopDied 6 points5 hours agoTrue.
The taggers do it to be SEEN and to "own" the thing tagged.
Seen by their friends.
If you paint over it IMMEDIATELY then they weren't seen. Then they stop bothering.
It means "We rule. Not you. Not the law. You are at our mercy here."
Social breakdown.

permalinkTrue_Curmudgeon 4 points5 hours agoBordering on the yard of the last house I owned in the city was a retaining wall which had been officially reserved by the local government for graffiti artists to practice on and the air would be constantly filled with the smell of spray paint as they created new and weird abominations on the wall constantly.
at least once they created something I just couldn't tolerate so I went in the basement and found a bucket of old paint and splashed over it

permalinkShakakka99 2 points1 hour agoI remember Adam Carolla talking about the overpasses in Oakland being covered in graffiti, so they put up razor wire to keep people from spraying them.  The razor wire made the overpass look like a prison, plus as people threw bags of garbage from their cars it would get caught in the razor wire, rip open, and just hang there looking absolutely disgusting.
But hey, they solved the graffiti problem.
permalinkPrandogolio 2 points3 hours agoIt's fine when it's done with talent and it's done WITH PERMISSION on a privately owned surface.  Essentially, a mural with the owner's approval.  It can definitely brighten up an urban atmosphere when the imagery is positive.
Shitty gangbanger spraypaint "tagging" their territory is awful and I have gone to clean that shit up on my own before because it should not be tolerated at all.

permalinkSavingPrivateGrace 2 points5 hours agoDC needs to do what Biden's Delaware does.  It's illegal in DE to sell spray paint to anyone under 18.  In addition, the spray paint is behind locked shelves that require a key and manager to open.  Also interesting that in Biden's Delaware there has been a curfew for years that no one under 18 is allowed out from 10pm to 6am, 24/7 and their businesses close in Wilmington by 6pm on Sundays, even their public transportation stops by 8pm.

gang tags, scratch, and throw ups are actual trash, done by trash people who don't respect their surroundings and the aesthetic of the art.

permalinkaquafan 0 points5 hours agoGraffiti can be beautiful‚Ä¶when painted on a canvas or on a wall owned by the artist. Graffiti, or any visual art for that matter, that is painted onto a surface without the surface owner‚Äôs consent is vandalism. Vandalism has no place in the capitol or anywhere in America.
If a private owner wants graffiti on his property, that‚Äôs his business, but it has no place as vandalism on public property.

permalinkview 12 more comments...556x45mm 2 points5 hours agoGraffiti originated from Italy, during a time when the government controlled all the newspapers. People would write political slogans on walls to get their message out, even the first political cartoonist started as graffiti. Through the years the message was lost and it became a way of "getting up" and "being seen", in other ways used by gangs to mark territory "tagging or tag banging". One individual kept it real to its roots, the artist known as Banksy.
Spez: in other words, if Hilary completed the steal and censorship ran wild including a "Department of Misinformation", this website and many others would be banned. Unfortunately the only way to get the message out would be through graffiti.
