permalinkPSX_X 13 points4 hours agoEven without the alien invaders, we still have to contend with the "inner city youths" beating and killing Whites with impunity.
permalinkApathySK 7 points4 hours agoThey do the same when rapefugee's go full on jihad and kill 70+ people with the truck of peace.
permalinkNotYourMan 2 points1 hour agoDiversity is a liability to a successful society like the US, France,  Germany, and the UK.  Successful societies like the US do not need diversity.  They absolutely do not require cultural diversity or racial diversity at the government level forcing businesses and universities to be culturally diverse.  Let merit make those decisions instead of incompetent government racist policies.
permalinkdrmrboy 57 points6 hours agoH1B's .............................. fucking get rid of ALL of them.  ðŸ¤“
permalinkbigdickhangsright 51 points6 hours agoWorse. They were illegals who somehow found it comfortable enough to get a license and drive a semi under Pedo Joe's reign.
permalinkBullet3250 35 points6 hours agoCalifornia gave them the CDL.... and they were ILLEGALS.
permalinkBallotsOnRubysUSB 12 points5 hours agoï¸Ž
... and they were INVADERS.

permalinkDrBJTester 2 points1 hour agoButt INVADERS that voted Pedocrat so that's diversity fren. KEK except it's not funny it's a felony.
permalinkNotYourMan 2 points1 hour agoH1B-visas do not benefit the middle class or the poor.  In truth the greatest number of millionaires in the US is in the H1B-visa high-tech workers.  Thousands of new millionaires in silicon valley that are H1B-visa workers buying up homes that US citizens can't afford thanks to democrats selling out the people.
permalinkLaquandavious 1 points30 minutes agoThis forumâ€™s messaging is that these people donâ€™t understand plumbing but are somehow millionaires eating up the tech capital of the world.  Honestly, I am going to go shit in the street every day if this gets me to a million faster than Dave Ramseyâ€™s get-rich-slow advice.
permalinkOnACloudOfTitties 1 points13 minutes agoShitting in the street is ALWAYS accompanied by wiping your ass with your hand.
permalinkIronWolve OP  40 points6 hours agoHe killed 3 people and is in jail.
The more you dig into this scam, the more sketchy it sounds, fly by night canadian cdl training, owns multiple trucks, what banks gave him the loans? What dispatchers did he drive for?
Harjinder Singh was operating as an independent carrier under his own name, based in Ontario, CA (USDOT 3066644). California issues CDLs to undocumented immigrants under AB 60 if they pass required tests, regardless of statusâ€”he entered illegally in 2018. Sources: FMCSA, Fox News, CA DMV.
According to carrier records, his operation included a fleet of 4 owned tractors (trucks) and 3 owned trailers, with no leased equipment listed.
permalinkJmradioman 37 points6 hours agoThere are white liberals whos job it is to coach illegals in getting loans and freebies that the Democratic States and Federal Gov. hand out.  It is why certain industries are control by forein migrants.  Gas stations, tobaco stores, dry cleaners.  That and it has been happening for so long no white American goes "I want to start a dry cleaner in a publix parking lot"
permalinkbringbackthe80s 18 points5 hours agoThat's exactly why they want uncontrolled illegal invasion. Their jobs depend on it.
permalinkJesusisKing 7 points4 hours agoHave you ever been to canada? Their strip malls have immigration lawyers like we have dollar generals...
permalinkbratt 11 points5 hours agoWhen you are willing to break the law illegally entering the country, Why stop there?
Questionable training
Operates and licensed by state that does not check citizenship
Possibly gets financing and loans using fraudulent information.
Dozens of trucking companies under the Harjinder Singh name in California https://opengovus.com/motor-carrier?name=HARJINDER+SINGH
How many are him? How many times did he start a new company due to accidents or tickets?
permalinkHere_we_go 3 points3 hours agoProbably a completely fake name and have 100s of people under that name. If they pulled over his 4 trucks the drivers are all named that
permalinkr_u_srs_srsly 8 points4 hours agoMeanwhile go ahead and try to get into trucking as a 25 year old white man and see if you can operate 4 trucks and 3 trailers.
permalinkamopheldupsidedown 4 points5 hours agoI think that's Ontario California, not Canada

A fatal wrong-way crash in Walnut Creek, California, on August 14, 2025, resulted in the death of a 16-year-old driver, Alina Safi, and injured four others.
Stratford, Connecticut (May 9, 2024) -
A wrong-way crash on Route 15 South in Stratford killed four people, including the wrong-way driver and three occupants of a minivan.
Denver, Colorado (June 8, 2025) -
A wrong-way crash on northbound Interstate 25 near the 20th Street exit killed one person and injured four others.
Two people were killed when a high-speed, wrong-way driver slammed into oncoming traffic in Santa Ana on Monday afternoon, causing a multi-car crash that left several others hospitalized.
Wisconsin Crash (July 20, 2025): Noelia Saray Martinez-Avila, an illegal alien from Honduras, was accused of driving the wrong way on a highway while intoxicated, killing two teenagers, Hallie Helgeson and Brady Heiling.
A woman who was in the U.S. illegally admitted to causing a head-on, wrong-way, crash that claimed the life of a young Missouri boy. The fatal crash happened when 33-year-old Endrina Bracho barreled down the highway the wrong way, going 75 miles per hour at the time of the crash, 35 miles above the posted speed limit,
and on and on....
we NEVER HAD so many 'wrong way drivers'
permalinkBallotsOnRubysUSB 6 points5 hours ago
wrong-way crash
You let illegals/INVADERS from countries that drive on the LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD, and don't have highways with more than one lane in each direction, and you're inviting DEATH AND CARNAGE.

permalinkmyke 1 points2 hours agoNo. Jarvis is sad. Jarvis... needs a minute, okay?
permalinkWarViper1337 3 points4 hours agoHappens on the daily here in Texas. What's funny is when the illegals crash into each other and they both just drive (or run) away because neither of them has insurance.
permalinkPatriotSkorzeny 17 points6 hours agoAnd what is law enforcement doing about it?
CA to Florida. Not one single weigh station or state trooper along the way. ðŸ¤£
permalinkciaramella_is_gay 25 points6 hours agoHe had a valid CDL because he used false papers to generate it or something like that.
California is literally seeding our country with untraceable terrorists. It's fucking obscene.
permalinkOldZilla 5 points6 hours agoWhile most would think what you write to be hyperbolic, it is most likely true. The left packing the census to retain power has inadvertently caused this to be true. The worst part is that in their warped minds if the plan fails, the sleeper cells killing Americans when they awake is justification for what the left did because if they were in power, in their minds they could of prevented the terror attacks.
permalinkciaramella_is_gay 5 points5 hours agoI live in CA and our votes don't count and like you said, they inflated the numbers during the census and stole seats as well.
Fucking hate these faggots, everyone out here would rather live under communist rule because of the California weather and food than free in "flyover America".
I wish I could go back in time and stop Reagan from surrendering California with Amnesty. Hopefully DJT doesn't make the same mistake.
permalinkCS_McFisticuffs_III 4 points5 hours agoWe need to stop recognizing California licenses as valid outside of California.

permalinkSavingPrivateGrace 8 points6 hours agoWe let diversity bullshit drive us and found out it doesn't work.  We got fucked around and found out.  Honk.  Honk.  Name one case where we benefited and are better for it.  Americans are the greatest.  Try being more like us in every way, and bring it back to whence you came from.
permalinkTheCandiru 6 points6 hours agoThis is GPrime85, or George Alexopoulos, on X and Insta. He's great. Go follow him.
permalinkAquamine-Amarine 2 points3 hours agoHe is, amazing takes on art and AI. He's absolutely right.
permalinkCaptain92 5 points5 hours agoMinorites often make crappy drivers.
They dont have the patience or awareness.
They are used to driving on undeveloped, unmaintained third world roads, and dont care about learning first world roads. Single lane dirt roads going up mountain cliffs at 200 feet in the air. If another car comes, they have to put it in reverse for 15 miles back down the mountain. They dont pave their swamps or cut and blast those mountains to the same degree as we do ours.
permalinkqueensjudyg 4 points5 hours agoThey can't read road signs/symbols, nor signs in English -- biggest problem!!!
permalinkcharliesean 4 points5 hours agoGPrime85
Fucking love this guy.
permalinkWooster97 4 points5 hours agoRemember truck weigh stations on the freeways??? Mandatory stopping points for all truckers they were.
How about we check immigration status of truckers at these stations?
permalinkChyNahAzzWhole1 3 points4 hours agoDIEVERSITY... fixed it.
permalinkNoimmigration 3 points4 hours agoMuslims are still running rampant in many states. Ice needs to amp it up big time
permalinkHumblePepe 3 points5 hours agoIt's always the same. Seeing an India staring on with empty eyes, zero remorse or empathy for the issue they caused.
permalinkNonbinaryPotatohead 2 points4 hours agoEND H1B PROGRAM.
It takes away the jobs and LIVES of America's natural born citizens.
Deport every single illegal.
Hold every person that led up to that illegal being in that truck accountable with legal punishment in a court of law with mandatory sentencing...no forgiveness with illegals involved because it amounts to treason (invasionary force on US soil, every one of them is behind a tragedy waiting to happen)
permalinkbased_trekkie 2 points3 hours agoReturn Mohinder!
I was driving in my minivan Saw a semi a big ol' Mack
Wasn't supposed to be U-turning
It's direction suddenly switched back
Return Mohinder, back to India home
No such Legal Immigration status known
You have accidents, innocents go splat,
I'm not sorry, you fucking Pajeets need to all go back
permalinkChoppermagic 2 points5 hours agoHonestly, his "don't care" attitude might be enough to finally spark a change to the H1Bs.  Has Elon weighed in on this?
permalinkglasscrawler 1 points2 hours agoReally like GPrime85's watercolors. First one I saw was the Hunter / Dorsey / Zuckerberg one from 2020.

permalinkPiratePatriotParrot PRO 1 points2 hours agoPajeet
permalinkDefinitelyNotFed 0 points5 hours agoZero disagreement that he had no right driving.
That said, some modicum of blame lies with the driver who wrecked right into him as they should have had the necessary distance to brake.
permalinkCyborne 4 points4 hours agoIt may have likely been a situation where this "driver" decided on the u turn and executed the turn from the second lane, those emergency access points on the highways are not designed for a vehicle that size to turn into and he likely made the turn from the outside lane this cutting off several lanes of travel.  I say that as a truck driver and based on the video of him standing there looking all smug with the trailer directly perpendicular to the road.
permalinkPied-Trumper 1 points3 hours agoDistance from where?! He was on the shoulder/opposite lane, subsequently making a u-turn across the entire road!
Are you an illegal too?
