permalinkTheRedPilledArtist 35 points2 hours agoIt's just like the story with that crazy witch E. Jean Carroll. They didn't have any evidence then either, but yet they found him liable anyway.
That needs to be overturned.
permalinkFuck_commies_2024 22 points2 hours agoThat’s one of the most mind boggling “judicial” decisions of all time. Traitorous judges should get the rope.
permalinkWhitePowerRanger 10 points1 hour agoCivil court is a fucking joke and it’s so much a joke, that actual civil cases are licensed to reality shows for our entertainment

I imagine Hell just being an eternity locked in a dressing room with her...
permalinkChimpanzeeFatigue 3 points1 hour agoStories that lead to evil biblical nightmares are THE DEVIL’S WORK
permalinknutmeg 22 points2 hours agoAnd I'm sure he looked especially hard to find some
permalinkAwan-CIA-Car-Lot 16 points2 hours agoHe didn't even look at ALL when it came to fraud in the 2020 election.
permalinkMrHarryReems 13 points2 hours agoHe actively prevented people from looking.
permalinkAwan-CIA-Car-Lot 7 points1 hour agoYou're right.  Now I remember some state's federal prosecutor starting to dig into it and Barr stopped him.
Can't stand him.
permalinkchickeninoven 8 points1 hour agoHe looked into a KFC bucket and never recovered.
permalinkWtf_socialismreally 8 points2 hours agoHe was too busy trying to load this arrow into their quiver.
permalinkNADSAQ 1 points43 minutes agofrankly i’m shocked they didn’t just fabricate some
permalinkTheRedPilledArtist 16 points2 hours agoBill Barr belongs behind Bars.
permalinkAwan-CIA-Car-Lot 8 points2 hours agoHe really does.
permalinkMaga305_47 1 points17 minutes agoAnd his father most likely
permalink5DchessWatch 1 points46 minutes agoHe would never hang out at bars, much less bartend.   You'd find him most of the time at kfc, but occassionally long john silvers.  I think fridays.  I think catholic lint fridays
Oh shit you mean prison.  I agree
permalinkAmerica_No_1 1 points29 minutes agoBan his ass from all fast food, pizza establishments, and buffets.  He can have a Thanksgiving meal once a year but must eat it with a bagpipe up his ass.  No way I aamt that fantasy eating 3 meals a day on my tax dollars.
permalinkVlad_The_Impaler 1 points44 minutes agoComment removed by community moderators.permalinkMythArcana 13 points2 hours agoOf course, he would have alerted all the media if he did.
permalinkEmodius 2 points43 minutes agoThey hid it all at the bottom of a box of Krispy Kremes he looked hard
permalinkWfdeacon88 12 points2 hours agoBarr himself would have prosecuted him if he did..
So hopefully Trump just setup the entire world/MSM for begging for the Epstein shit and will dump it all out there now showing Bill Gates is a fucking pedo.
Honestly at this point, just give me Bill Gates + FAUCI in prison this year and I'll call year one a success.
permalinkzooty 1 points26 minutes agoI'm not sure. I feel like Barr was playing good cop in good cop/bad cop. It probably would have leaked somehow though.
permalinkairborne3502 9 points2 hours agoThat was an easy one.
While you're here, did you do anything to investigate the 2020 election?
Did you do anything to obstruct investigation into the 2020 election?
permalinkAwan-CIA-Car-Lot 4 points1 hour agoThis right here.  Corrupt bastard.
permalinkCianevalies 8 points2 hours agoWell DUH . If there was it would have been rolled out 10 years ago
permalink556x45mm 2 points1 hour ago^this
Why would they spend billions trying to defeat him in the elections, spend billions in media narratives, petty criminal charges, assassination attempts, etc?
permalinkLol_Garrus 5 points2 hours agoWhy does this get brought up?
If dirt existed, we all know damn well it would be out by now.
permalinkEdBuck 4 points2 hours agoYes most of us know, but it doesn't stop the left from spewing TrUmPpEdOfIlEs
permalinkMAGAguitar 4 points2 hours agoBill Barr’s answers seem designed only to placate those in power. A real company man
permalink5DchessWatch 1 points45 minutes agoIs he a man though.  I think of him more of a goblin
He's like if Ralphie Parker from a Christmas Story was instead kidnapped by CIA and put into an MKULTRA program, and then let loose in the world; but like Brittany Spears had some weird sex fetish with fast food--in her case Mcdonalds, in his KFC.  Maybe pepsi had some mkultra sponsorship and they slipstreamed in a few KFC Ads with his advanced sleeper cell training REMrape program. Took on a new persona Billy Billbarr Baggins
Then Billy / Ralphie got fat, became a lawyer for CIA, then when they tried to active his sleeper skills, he just ate more KFC and fell asleep on his computer, and many people in his operation died.
So they let him go.  And Trump hired him.
That's the long tale of The great Billy Billbarr Baggins, a metabolically deranged shire hobbit once called Ralphie from Christmas story
permalinkTEXinLA 3 points2 hours agoSee No Evil

Off to KFC
permalinkgoodtimebox 3 points1 hour agoBill Barr is a fat faggot.
permalinkPrandogolio 2 points1 hour agoNo shit
GEOTUS isn't a diddler
permalinkMastaJoda 2 points1 hour agoWhy does this show seem like its only intended to confirm Trump is innocent of kid fucking? Its a hoax amirite? There's no evidence or list, right? So, why make a spectacle of nothing? Why is everyone only leaking that Trump's definitely not an Epstien pedo even though thats all totally a hoax?
This shit just doesn't sit well with me.. Now the Trump DOJ is turning over the Epstien evidence and Congress will grift tf out of it for some midterm clout with the RINO voting retarded normie Republicans.
Fuck this sim.
permalinkdogofwar 2 points1 hour agoBecause that's the spectacle that Qtards and Democrats turned it into. They made the Epstein hoax entirely about Trump.
permalinkAraket 2 points1 hour agoSet up.
permalinkKlaus73 2 points44 minutes agoWait....but I thought the reason we are not allowed to see the Epstien files is because they are probably chock full of false information added by Biden...Did Bill see those files?
Seriously get your fucking story straight - either its tampered and folks gotta deal with the false fallout; or its not tampered and its being withheld under bullshit permise.
permalinkHocusLocus 1 points16 minutes agoStale bread and moldy circuses
permalinkJakylangelo 2 points1 hour agoWell bill, we know you’re implicated… a long line of implicated.
permalinkhenri_derelicte 2 points1 hour agoI suspect any reference to Trump in the Epstein files is a nothing burger. If it was of consequence, the Dems would have leaked it in 2024
permalinkingrowntoenail 2 points1 hour agoDoes that mean he's saying there is no info or that he knows it exists but didn't see it?  I fully believe there is nothing "bad" against Trump but he may be mentioned in the files.
permalinkthecave888 2 points1 hour agoNO SHIT. So stupid how people think in 2025 if there was anything to damage Trump how it wouldn't have been released years ago.
permalinkYodaBannon 2 points1 hour agoHe was the father on Happy Days right?
permalinkKernalMustard 2 points56 minutes agoCant unsee it now
permalinkPsarg 2 points1 hour agoBill Barr's dad hired Epstein, and out of all people they made him Attorney General.
permalinkBidenSniffsLittleKid 2 points2 hours agoYeah we know who the files would implicate and that’s why we can’t see them
permalinkTrumperoo 2 points1 hour agoWho cares what this fat lard bucket fuck has to say?
permalinkbillybaldwin2 2 points1 hour agoI believe it. Otherwise, Dems would have used it a loooong time ago. I'm not talking about in 2024, I'm talking about in the 90s when Trump was a GOP donor.
permalinkFuck_commies_2024 2 points2 hours agoBecause it ain’t none.
permalinksumadartson 1 points44 minutes agoBill Barr hasn't ever seen anything.
permalinkAllTheWayTrump 1 points26 minutes agoDuh
permalinkSCP0073 1 points41 minutes agoNo, but he heavily - very heavily, indeed - implied there could be evidence he hasn’t seen and that the media should run with that headline.
permalinkSurfandTurf 1 points1 hour agowtf, I love this fat deep state Jew turncoat now!!!
permalinkchampdog 1 points6 minutes agoThis motherfucker is just trying to avoid the rope.
permalinkRudy_DankMemer 1 points40 minutes agofuck Bill Barr
permalinkthrottlejohnson 1 points39 minutes agoyeah because if they had anything they would have buried trump...
permalinkRationalThought 1 points5 minutes agoThey also said they can't get testimony from Mueller anymore because he is too far gone.
permalinkMEME-SUPREME 1 points36 minutes agoFuck that fat fuck.
Charge him with treason.
permalinksuitwo_wtr 1 points51 minutes agoHe also can't see anything beyond what's on his plate so I don't take his word to mean anything.
permalink5DchessWatch 1 points49 minutes agoBillbar doesn't see anything other than the bottom of an empty KFC bukkitt.  This is the beginning and the end of the tale of Billy BillBarr Baggins...master of  his precious puffinpipe organ
Back to obscurity you go, company slobb hobbit
permalinkDiddlywac3 1 points31 minutes agoTrump is the cleanest politician ever
permalinkRedPillosopher1776 1 points49 minutes agoIf he had you can bet your ass he'd have made sure everyone knew it.
