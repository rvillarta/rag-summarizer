permalinkTheSonOfGadsden 20 points2 hours agoI think Kurt Russell does. Not 100% sure
permalinkvongregormench 4 points1 hour agoI think politics might be why he and Goldie Hawn had a falling out, of course that‚Äôs just speculation.

permalinkWorldtraveler0405 7 points2 hours agoWhat about Adam Sandler, or just a silent supporter?
permalinkNoApologyTour 2 points48 minutes agoHe‚Äôs probably not a supporter
permalinkYT45 1 points44 minutes agoIf not, he‚Äôs not going out of his way to be a self-righteous cockweasel about it, which at least is good.
permalinkPickles76 4 points50 minutes agoNorm MacDonald (RIP)
permalinkPickles76 1 points49 minutes agoClint Eastwood?
permalinkMortal_Wombat 3 points52 minutes agoImpressive length!
permalinkLol_Garrus 27 points2 hours agoThe left cannot be reasonable.
They believe men and become women and kids can learn about porn. They advocate for war and want their political enemies in camps.
permalinkMedicallyReddit 19 points2 hours agoThey also call killing babies ‚Äúreproductive healthcare‚Äù. They are evil and worship Satan
permalinkBidenShowerDrool 0 points58 minutes agoand Right to Life.....the most Satanic grouping of words to describe the  the death and mutilation of developing babies.
permalinkHuntersDeeler 2 points2 hours agoTrump wants his political enemies locked up and we all support it.
permalinkLol_Garrus 6 points2 hours agoHe wants criminals locked up for criminal activity.
permalinkMike_Hoxbigg 1 points3 minutes ago^^ This is the differentiator.
Are they his political enemies? You bet. But he wants them locked up for being criminals, not assholes. Sometimes we just get that value-added bonus.
permalinkCJ74U2NV 1 points25 minutes agoThe thing I hate most about the left is that they cannot agree to disagree. It is okay to have differing opinions on topics. But they just want to hate everyone that does not agree with them. And latetly, their viewpoints are so far out of touch and immoral that it's impossible to agree with them.
permalinkMatterThatMetals 12 points2 hours agoHollywood actors. Probably compromised.
permalinkbooblitchutz 31 points2 hours agoHey, give it up for the guy. He's more or less been on the right side of things the whole time hasn't he? Coming out in favor of Trump right now puts him at odds with a lot of Pedowood elites.
permalinkEDDIT_IS_CUCKED 13 points2 hours agoI think he's about as good as it gets for people in Hollyweird. He does seem to be on the right side usually, but he still works with and probably holds many secrets of all the pedos in the industry.
permalinkMatterThatMetals 7 points2 hours agoYeah, I hope he's not one of them. But ... most of them are. We shall see.
permalinkFatigueIsReal 4 points2 hours agoIt helps that he's a devout Christian.

permalinkDeportAllFeds 1 points2 hours agoThe pedos are on the Epstein list and flight logs. It all needs to be released so we can round them up.
permalinkHuntersDeeler -6 points2 hours agoSo that‚Äôs how we measure people‚Äôs character now? Whether they‚Äôre for Trump or not? We‚Äôre not a fucking cult.
permalinkTDBabyBite 2 points54 minutes agoNo it shows they're just not braindead retards. Or absolute lunatics
permalinkmaga_gal2 10 points2 hours agoHe's been right winged his whole public life
permalinkBunny 1 points2 hours agoIt‚Äôs funny how he took a RFK Jr approach - marry into the Kennedy fam and become more right wing.  I guess Arnold did the same, really.. üòÇ
permalinkReturningtogod 6 points2 hours agoThe ‚Äúfuck your freedoms‚Äù Arnold - that guy?
permalinkNonbinaryPotatohead 4 points2 hours agoNo one seems to want to remember that part here LOL
permalinkview 1 more comments...Mulletgunning 1 points37 minutes agoHe also just called Trump a pussy in so many words about meeting Pooty poot. Fuck Ah-nold!! MAGA AF
permalinkairborne3502 10 points2 hours ago"It's like we're just playing cards, or playing Mafia or, having dinner."
That's a funny image Chris Pratt and RFK Jr playing Mafia the video game.
permalinkSidewinder24 8 points2 hours agoMy sister went to high school with him. She said he was a goofball. Seems like a stand up guy now. Got into incredible shape and earned his massive success. Of course Hollywood doesn't like him.
permalinkChoppermagic 7 points2 hours agoOne of the few Hollywood actors that didn't become worshippers of Satan.
permalinkblackpepe 5 points2 hours agothe left has hated this guy for awhile
permalinkbillybaldwin2 4 points1 hour agoChris Pratt is an American dream. He started out as a chunky waiter. Waiting tables while getting parts here and there. Then he got buff. Suddenly, he's a Hollywood leading man for billion dollar franchises.
Be like Chris Pratt. You don't have to be Hollywood, get your life together, achieve your goals and work your way up higher than you could imagine.
permalinkShadow-Band 3 points52 minutes ago‚ÄúIf you could reason with Democrats, there wouldn‚Äôt be any Democrats‚Äù. - Clint Eastwood
permalinkProudAmerican84 3 points2 hours agoI‚Äôve always loved Chris Pratt! Great actor and I love his films. Especially ‚ÄúGuardians of the galaxy‚Äù
permalinkthecave888 2 points2 hours agoGood job, Pratt. Keep it up. Really enjoyed is Amazon Prime military series.
permalinkJack_HinsonTN 1 points35 minutes agoThe Terminal List. And yes, absolutely one of the best shows in recent years.
permalinkReturnOfSmarm 2 points58 minutes agoJust watched the first GOG the other night ...... he was fucking epic.
permalinkTedWLieu 2 points1 hour agoSTAR LORD!!
permalinkGoldwaterVoter 2 points2 hours ago"who is the most divisive president ever,"
Nuff said, Chris.
permalinknotsuicidalatall 2 points1 hour agoNo offense to anyone, seriously.  But when you think about what it takes to become an actor, i.e. the ability to pretend to be someone you are not, and probably couldn't do what you do without a person standing next to you 'directing' you, it shouldn't be surprising that these same people are so easily duped into believing everything they read in main stream media, and at their little social outings and fund raisers.  I doubt the huge majority of these artists have any critical thinking ability.
permalinkUltimatePistachio 1 points19 minutes agoYou nailed it on the head. Actors in general are really dumb. Some can be really smart and just good at acting, and those smart ones can end up directing too, or just do other things ...
I had a European history professor in college who would tell us that Americans were known to look up to actors foolishly, while Europeans would be more concerned with the directors and didn't give a shit about the actors.
permalinkTwoWords 2 points2 hours agoPaywalled tabloid
permalinkjonzor82 1 points19 minutes agoChris Pratt may be a good guy
But "Tomorrow War" was a horrible movie
permalinkVlad_The_Impaler 1 points3 minutes agoComment removed by community moderators.permalinkHuntersDeeler 1 points2 hours agoYeah that‚Äôs fine but the Epstein list needs to be released. Then we can count it as another success.
permalinkTophat9000 1 points2 minutes agoIt's simple... I can respect rational disagreement I can respect people that are not Trump supporters
What I don't respect is the is the completely irrational Trump haters that literally say the most absurd things constantly
permalinkRoosterCrow 1 points51 minutes agoBill Maher looks like he‚Äôs sitting in an oversized chair. Must be a tiny fella.
permalinkYT45 1 points40 minutes agoMaher is a physical midget and by all accounts a colossal asshole.
permalinkHumphreyPlowjogger 1 points27 minutes agoThere is nothing reasonable about lefty anti-Trumpers. They are irrational and violent.
permalinkecto_coolest 1 points9 minutes agoReally surprising that he hasn‚Äôt been cancelled
permalinkJohnCawktoastin 1 points9 minutes agoShort read and "interview" and not a lot of roasting going on.
This is G v E. There's no middle ground in it. They don't want me, or you, alive. I'm not worried about right or wrong anymore vs them. Either save your country or die trying.
permalinkNonbinaryPotatohead -1 points2 hours agoHis father in law told us "fuck your freedom"
permalinkMuslimsWorshipSatan 6 points2 hours agoWho the fuck cares what someone's father in law says. Are you your father in law? Are you responsible for what he says?
permalinkNonbinaryPotatohead -4 points2 hours agoKeep depending upon hollywood goofballs to tell you how to live
permalinkMuslimsWorshipSatan 2 points1 hour agoIf your brain was capable of operating on a level beyond that of a 2nd grader, you might have noticed that I never said one fucking word about Chris Pratt, his opinions, or whether they should be relied on, and that the entirety of my comment was about how irrelevant the opinions of someone's father in law are to someone's own opinions.  But because you have less ability to process multiple thoughts simultaneously than a 1972 graphing calculator, all you were able to process is 'hurrr someone opposed my comment with their comment, they must be in favor of all the stuff I'm against'.
permalinkfallhollow -4 points2 hours agocan't forget he ditched his first wife and started "dating" his second one before the divorce was final
edit: downvote all you want, just because he says the right things sometimes does not mean he's "on our side"
he is trying to keep his brand intact
permalinkwartooth6 4 points2 hours agoIf that's the worst you can dig up on him, then he really is doing better than the rest of Hollywood.
Let's not forget how reddit used to worship the ground he walked on, especially back in his Parks & Rec days.  Once his became an open Christian, they threw him to the curb.
permalinkNonbinaryPotatohead 2 points2 hours agoWe throw people to the curb here from the pro-America movement all the time LOL
permalinkNotInFormation 3 points2 hours agoThat‚Äôs 1990s-era Dem tactics.  Clinton humping everything while the Ds and MSM hold conservatives to a standard that nuns would fail.
permalinkBlackPilledMAGA 1 points2 hours agoRelationships and court deadlines don't end at the same time. Why do you have to wait for a court to tell you it's over? She was probably doing the same thing.
