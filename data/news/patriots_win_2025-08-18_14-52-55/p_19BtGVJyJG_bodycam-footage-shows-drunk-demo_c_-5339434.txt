permalinkMcFatty7 8 points12 minutes agoWomen love to put men in jail for the smallest, pettiest things, but when they get themselves get arrested for something actually more serious, like trespassing and being drunk in public, they throw an absolute hissy fit.
#PussyPassDenied
permalinkHockeyMom4Trump 5 points4 minutes agoBut she’s an AG! An AG! An AG!
She needs a good swift kick in the ass. What an embarrassment.
permalinkFilo76 1 points2 minutes agoDefinitely the best example of PussyPassDenied I've seen in a while.  🤣
permalinkBingo_is_my_namo 14 points21 minutes agoIf she's this entitled to the cops imagine how she treated the restaurant staff.
permalinkebuy123 7 points9 minutes agowell, she is an AG
permalinkHockeyMom4Trump 2 points2 minutes agoShe can act like an ass because she’s an AG!
But don’t dare let Bob the random guy behave like that or she would prosecute him!
permalinkHere_we_go 4 points8 minutes agoImagine being the faggot married to either of them?
The beard aint worth it.
permalinkHockeyMom4Trump 1 points2 minutes agoNo wonder the divorce rate is so high.
permalinkMoebius 11 points18 minutes agoTypical Drunk Karen behavior.  Look at any of the thousands of body cam videos and you'll see the common elements of entitlement and resistance to authority.
permalinkRuleoVicus 1 points6 minutes agoFemales make up like 3/4ths of bodycam since lockdowns. It's broken their psyche.
permalinkTheMustacheBandit 6 points17 minutes agoDemocrats have learned they are above the law.  You can’t blame them, they have been conditioned for many years to believe this.
permalinkHere_we_go 1 points6 minutes agoNow do any minority, gay, tranny etc

permalinkHere_we_go 1 points5 minutes agoShe might be an AG. Possibly.
permalinkHockeyMom4Trump 1 points23 seconds agoShe’s an AG! Soooo important and above the law!
permalinkswift_water 4 points18 minutes agoTbf, any woman would behave the exact same way.
permalinkTrumpAndGodWin 6 points12 minutes agoAs youtube comments say "children in adult bodies."
permalinkHere_we_go 2 points6 minutes agoHave been drunk as a skunk on bourbon street. Still never acted like this.
permalinkHockeyMom4Trump 1 points1 minute agoNo. I would never behave like that. My parents taught me better than that.
I am like Trump. I don’t even drink alcohol.

permalinkbleeje 3 points15 minutes agoThe only difference between 2015 and now is that for the past decade some or other old and fat dumbfuck porn addict would have triggered an avalanche of 'Would!' memes.
Now, OF has completely desensitized right-wing simps to women who aren't topless. And so, they're able to see these creatures for what they truly are.
permalinkRuleoVicus 0 points5 minutes agoSounds like projection from you.
permalinkhumble_kekistani 3 points14 minutes agolol of course its Newport
permalinkKolob64 3 points13 minutes agoThank heaven for body cams or they might have made trouble for the cops.
permalinkOftenDisgusted 3 points13 minutes agoThis twit nitwit loser should realize that "No one is above the law".  Can she be deported for a DUI??  Hopefully, this inappropriate arrogant self-important goof will be disbarred and fined.  The cop should have tazed her.
permalinkPeaceMakerDJT 3 points10 minutes agoWith Trump in office, people can finally do their job without feeling the repercussions
permalinkCaptRied 3 points9 minutes agoTwo obnoxious drunk women and a beta male try to enter a restaurant.  What could go wrong.
That officer deserves a promotion.  Cop to drunk woman's beta male husband; "Could you get your children outta here?"
permalinkDeplorachuIChooseYou 3 points9 minutes agoMan he wiped the smug smile off her face real quick with that response. Good job officer.
permalinkThePatriotGames2016 2 points6 minutes agoThey really believe that 'no one is above the law' shit, eh?
permalinkThePatriotGames2016 2 points6 minutes agoThey wanted body cams, apparently not anymore.
permalinkCaptainForehead 1 points3 minutes agoShe should have told the officers she was an AG.
permalinkThePatriotGames2016 1 points26 seconds agoWomen are why we have the 5th amendment. Fucking hell
permalinkBigMikesChef -1 points17 minutes agoThe Gayway Pundit is a terrible source.
permalinkCaptRied 3 points8 minutes agoThe video is on YouTube.
permalinkRuleoVicus 1 points3 minutes agoThere's a seething hatred of Gateway by a select few retards on this site. They follow Ben Shapiro though.
