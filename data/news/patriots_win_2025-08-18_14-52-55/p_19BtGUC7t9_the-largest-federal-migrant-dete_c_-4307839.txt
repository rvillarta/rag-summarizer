permalinkRobinNet 18 points6 hours agoYep. Migrants migrate north to do seasonal work LEGALLY, then MIGRATE back home. Like birds and butterflies.
permalinkrebuildingMyself 11 points6 hours agoAnd even that can't go away quick enough when robots/automation take those jobs.
permalinkFormer_RM2 2 points5 hours agoI don't know how old you are, but back in the 80s and 90s the tomatoes you would get on your fast food burger were soft, red and tasted like tomatoes. The reason they are hard, orange and taste like shit today is because they genetically altered them to be able to withstand machine picking and to last longer in storage.
Some things are just better left to be picked by hand.
permalinkFecklessgod 7 points5 hours agoThey also pick them when they're not ripe. Then they Condition them with gas To turn them red, But they are still not ripe.
I grew my own tomatoes this year And they are incredibly tasty When ripe. The consistency of the green tomatoes I have are akin to the red ones from the store in terms of taste, softness, and overall ripeness. The store-bought tomatoes cannot even come close to my ripe tomatoes.
permalinkview 2 more comments...DickTick PRO 1 points5 hours agoYep, they have done that to quite a few crops to try to make them hardier during the picking and transport phases and they all taste worse than the original
permalinkbangbus 0 points5 hours agoConcurrently, robust markets developed wherein if you want hand picked organic tomatoes for $12 a pound you can get them. It's a win-win. I'm not judging Taco Bell on the quality of the three slivers of tomato they put on my Doritos Tacos Locos Supreme.
permalinkJohnCawktoastin 0 points5 hours agoNothing like a fresh summer garden tomato that tastes like sun and earth.
permalinkFecklessgod 3 points5 hours agoThese people are more like invasive species.
permalinkAnother_ID 1 points5 hours ago"Migrants" migrate?
What a concept.
permalinkSaxonlady 4 points6 hours agoI know. I hold my nose when I pick my battles too.
As long as they lock up the invaders eh!
permalinkOldman1945 2 points3 hours agoWe need to deport, not detain. Trump’s 3k per day goal won’t even mean 1 million per year are deported if we have 30 million illegals, that’s going to take more than 30 years!! Step up the deportations!
permalinkDontTreadOnSnek 26 points6 hours agoWake me up when they start rounding up everyone openly speaking Spanish.
I had some nasty ass dude ask me in bad English the price of saltine crackers last night at work and he pointed with his nasty, hairy feet. Let his flip flop drop to the floor and pointed with his toe.
They ALL need to go.
permalinkCovfefeVideo 12 points6 hours agoSaltine-inquiring motherfuckers!
permalinkPickles76 2 points6 hours agoEven hairy hobbits have more class than that!!

no good news is ever good enough.  no win is ever big enough.
you motherfuckers are the worst.
permalinktholinz 16 points6 hours agoThis better be nothing but a place to fingerprint and warehouse them until there's enough for a flight back to their country.
permalinkdukeofdoorcounty 7 points6 hours agoBetter yet a railroad line over the border with Mexico.  Boxcars, lots of boxcars
permalinkMayorMcSixaplix 7 points5 hours agoShould be hot, non-air conditioned school buses with low-rise vinyl seats. Two stops only: Scheinbaum's house, then the Panama Canal turnaround.

Coal cars (with tops), containers on flat cars, oil cars, etc.
Let's not be boxed in here.

permalinkecto_coolest 1 points5 hours agoI hope they at least abuse them a little first
permalinkRationalThought 1 points2 hours agoIt's where they wait for their court and then wait again until enough go through that court  and they can be shipped. It's a huge bottleneck in the system is housing them during  that timeframe but as you see the more they build the more ICE they try to hire. Deportations will reach mass "production" in probably a year or right around the mid terms.
permalinkterribletwos 1 points6 hours agoIt's where they're processed for canning.
permalinkMamapedia 13 points6 hours agoI voted for this.
permalinkChimpanzeeFatigue 7 points6 hours agoPlease come to Albuquerque Mr. President. All the illegals from neighboring states are flooding here because they think they have the best chance of avoiding deportation.
permalinkIfeargovtmorethan 5 points6 hours agoNot a fun part of country.....love it
permalinkhillaryforprison 5 points5 hours agoWhy do we need beds and buildings to deport illegals? Just bus them out immediately . Why feed and house them and all that crap. Leave now, the end.
permalinkJohnCawktoastin 2 points5 hours agoI hear ya. Seems to me when they were illegally herded through by Bidens crew the first time they were given a phone, a debit card and a ride by bus or plane and sent on their way STAT.
permalinkWashington_Redskins 5 points6 hours agoAre they using C-5's to fly in the alligators?
permalinkSide_o_beef_curtains 5 points6 hours agoI was hoping for A-10's

permalinkperma-maga 4 points6 hours agoDoes it have an airport?
permalinkTheBasedFriscoMan 3 points5 hours agoIt’s a fort, so yeah.
permalink10gauge 4 points6 hours agoTexas knows how to herd cattle.
permalinkCMDRConanAAnderson 4 points6 hours agoThey need to be more efficient, lately I've been thinking of turning all those Beiden era processing facilities into deportation processing facilities. They have to use everything that allowed them in against them. Lately I've been wondering if the Patriot act can be used by ICE to spy on illegals too!
permalinkbratt 1 points5 hours ago
if the Patriot act can be used by ICE to spy on illegals
If they are at the point they can spy on them, they should be deporting them.
They could monitor phone transmissions for any foreign languages and triangulate.
permalinkJustlooking250 3 points4 hours agoIllegal Aliens , not migrants
permalinkMythArcana 3 points6 hours agoThe stars at night are big and bright [clap, clap, clap, clap], Deep in the heart of Texas!
permalinkBruddahIz 2 points6 hours agoThis could be a weed out trick for quick identification.  "Of course I'm in Texas ..."
permalinkGiggleFarts1960 3 points6 hours agoThe largest federal migrant detention center in American history, so far.
permalinkPickles76 3 points5 hours agoWouldn’t need the “largest” if they hadn’t let in the largest amount of illegals in history!  If the reeeeee about the size they can blame the xiden admin
permalinkcanada_is_communist 2 points5 hours agoStop calling them "migrants".
Call them invaders. They're invaders.

permalinkJackLemon 2 points5 hours agoMigrant is such a globalist created euphemism. They are illegal aliens or even more accurately, they are invaders.
permalinkbleeje 2 points6 hours agoWow. Nice.

permalinkthebeercules 1 points5 hours agoTime to fuel up the deportation dozers!
permalinkGoldwaterVoter 1 points6 hours agoRight on the border. So handy! Not even a small trebuchet required -- just a sack lunch, a cold Dr. Pepper, and a GTFO sign pointing south.
permalinkMmnGA 1 points5 hours agoLargest federal migrant detention center... so far
permalinkSavingPrivateGrace 1 points6 hours agoEverything really is bigger in Texas!  FAFO, bye-bye Juan.

permalinkWhozat 1 points5 hours agoMake sure Fronk from father knows best is sent there. His character is from the 50s and was illegal.
permalinktheDialecticalPlaya 1 points5 hours agoThere's a bunch of Muslims in Sugarland that should be sent there to christen its opening.
