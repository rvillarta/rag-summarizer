Across the country, exhibitions with LGBTQ art and themes are being altered, postponed or outright canceled under Trump 2.0. Toobigtorig123 OP  5 points4 days agoCurators say queer art is being censored in the US. NBC News reports that last month’s cancelation of Amy Sherald’s LGBTQ-inclusive Smithsonian show “American Sublime” marked the latest in a growing wave of LGBTQ-related art censorship at major museums in 2025. In February, Washington D.C.’s Art Museum of the Americas abruptly canceled “Nature’s Wild With Andil Gosine,” a group show inspired by Gosine’s book on Caribbean sexuality and activism. Critics noted the timing followed Trump administration directives to eliminate “anti-American” content from cultural institutions. Art historian Jonathan D. Katz has connected these events to long-standing tensions over sexuality in art, tracing them back to the Mapplethorpe controversy of the late 1980s........and it is about time they stop forcing their agenda on the rest of Americans
