Shoot them in the head. Violent offenders cannot be rehabilitated.
I feel the same way about ALL of the derp state pedos on the Eggstein list.
permalinkAVeryNakedMan 13 points2 hours agoThe key to stopping crime is not just getting the initial arrest, but refusing to grant bail to them and actually holding them in jail before & after conviction for long periods of time.
If you just arrest and release, as leftists cities have been doing ever since George Soros funded his left wing prosecutors all over America, you end up with the case of a criminal with 25+ prior arrests, who never stops crime because there is no real punishment.
permalinkAmannamedRJ 2 points57 minutes agoThey were doing it long before him. They've been pretending their racialist new police policies were "criminal reform." Ever since Stop and Frisk became "evil" probably before it.
Stop and frisk is a constitutional violation, BTW and I disagree with it, but the law in general is so hung up on "rehabilitating" that it gives people who deserve zero chances infinite numbers of chances.
Saw a video where a woman had a dead child (about 7 years old, severely underweight. rotting some 14 months) and her dead brother (also severely underweight, rotting some 3 months) in the back of her trunk. Woman was about 36 - she got 50 years with the possibility of Parole... This means it's entirely possible that an abusive 2-time child murderer can walk the streets again before she's 60. Witnesses around the time of the girl's death reported constant screaming and threats of beatings through hotel windows.
In what way does letting this woman go rehabilitate her? why would anybody pretend they want somebody like that rehabilitated?? In what way is it perfectly acceptable
permalinkFBJ_WoodChipper 1 points1 hour agoAtleast arrest and then release them in El Salvador. They'd be gone for a long time kek
permalinkTheRedPilledArtist 8 points2 hours agoMany of them killers, rapists, muggers... good to get them off the streets. Frankly we should get them out of America, but we have to start somewhere.
permalinkMemeWarsVet 7 points2 hours agoWithout any numbers to compare these to prior to the Guard coming in, this means nothing.
permalinkicreatedthisforthis 3 points1 hour agoUnless its politicians who were arrested, nothing changes.
permalinkMatterThatMetals 7 points2 hours agoNice. Real nice. How about the REAL criminals in DC?
permalinkGildoom 4 points2 hours agoAfter Trump is done, the talking point from the dems of 30% decrease in crime, will actually be true.
permalinkYodaBannon 3 points2 hours agoMAGA stands for peace, law and order. Love, Bela, Covfefe üá∫üá∏
permalinkpatrioticwinning3 3 points2 hours agoYes, but its not the politicians guilty of treason... disappointing...

In Washington, D.C., approximately 42.5% of the population identifies as Black or African American (Non-Hispanic), according to Data USA. This makes them the largest ethnic group in the city
permalinkHunter77 1 points1 hour agoI don't see us exiling 43% of the population of DC.
permalinkPrandogolio 1 points2 hours agoCrime is just the culture in DC
permalinkflashersenpai 1 points1 hour agoMeanwhile another Israeli pedo is allowed to flee the US and the State Dept. tries to cover it up. If only he tried to fuck kids in DC instead of Nevada!

permalinkdeleted1 points2 hours agocjcivicx 1 points2 hours agoFeds are in charge now.
permalinkbillybaldwin2 1 points1 hour agoKinda shocked at that. I assume criminals would hear National Guard is there, maybe I'll stay home tonight and not "crime." Unless now raids and warrants can happen when National Guard is hanging out, so cops can actually go after criminals.
permalinkPeaceMakerDJT 1 points2 hours agoSend them to alligator alcatraz
permalinkMythArcana 1 points2 hours agoHe just had a bunch of criminals at the White House, that could have been at least ten more for the wagon.
permalinkTrumpOrTreason 1 points1 hour agoAny illegals?
permalinksplink 1 points2 hours agoAnd these are just the ones too stupid to leave town for a while.
permalinkairborne3502 1 points2 hours agoA lot of things in the Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Act look pretty good, like oversight, until you get into limitations on the use of deadly force.
I can see why the DC Police Union wants it repealed.
You can't tie a street cop's hands.
22 multi-agency teams, with 1,950 participants, are making one hell of an impact.
There's a lot of things they waste our tax money on and seeing our government agencies go to work and do their jobs, keeping our streets safe, doesn't bother me one bit.
permalinkBraineack 1 points1 hour agoNo one likes when Giuliani cleaned up New York City, until he did...
