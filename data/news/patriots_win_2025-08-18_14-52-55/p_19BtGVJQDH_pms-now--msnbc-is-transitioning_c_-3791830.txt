permalinkMythArcana 14 points2 hours agoIt just adds an extra level of gay to an already overly gay fake network.
permalinkWtf_socialismreally 13 points2 hours agoDid they get upset at "MSDNC"?
permalinkOutlawPurpleHairDye 9 points1 hour agoPossibly.  Regardless, I'm going to miss calling it MSDNC because a mouthpiece for the DNC is pretty much exactly what they are.
permalinkWtf_socialismreally 4 points1 hour agoJust call it DNC Now

permalinkNotYourMan 5 points1 hour agoIt appears that being woke, racist, and the mouthpiece of the democrat party destroyed the brand.  Seems retarded.  But its nice to watch Trump's effect take down these punks!

permalinkQuestionable 3 points1 hour agoMicrosoft de-invested from their site back in 2005. Why they've held onto that name for so long is anyone's guess.

Sorry msnbcioccio, you'll never be a REAL boy
permalinkSR91Aurora 3 points2 hours agoIt's fascinating to have watched the arc of these major establishment institutions throw away all their credibility to lie about Trump for four years, culminating in an attempt to take over the world with covid.
And their gambit utterly failed, and now they're totally exposed without any credibility we can now enjoy watching the lying establishment mouthpieces crumble one by one. Watching the Democrats fumbling to fix their party from it's rotten core is the best part.
Historians are calling the 2024 presidency the beginning of the seventh party system.

They never had real credibility, it was all propaganda, and always has been. It began with industrialists buying about a dozen of the most influential newspapers in the U.S. It began in late 1800s and increased as time crawled into the 1920s.

permalinkGarudaDarkblack 2 points39 minutes ago"My Source News Opinion World"
What the fuck is this piece of shit?
Obviously they put Opinion right in the name to avoid defamation cases when all of their "news" is really just their deranged opinions. They still kept News in the name in an attempt to sound somewhat legitimate. I assume My Source refers to their anonymous sources which are just themselves making shit up and World refers to getting their narratives from the WEF and other globalists. A bold and retarded move.

Clearly written by a DEI hire in the marketing department.
permalinkImthebest 2 points49 minutes agoIt's incredible that the very last comment on here is the only one who said what they renamed it to. Amazing new name by the way, it requires commas too, love it
permalink67Vert 1 points40 minutes agoThey should drop the N representing News. Opinion is highly accurate.
