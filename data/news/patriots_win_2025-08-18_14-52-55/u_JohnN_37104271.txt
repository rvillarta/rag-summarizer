I used to work in that world.  I'd say 60% completely lazy.  30% okay.  10% earned their paycheck and then some.

You're the master of "facts," like the "fact" that Patel said he'd turn the FBI headquarters into a museum.

There is no "progress."  As soon as the Dems take control (which they will), the FBI will be the same completely fucked up agency it was under Biden.  Nothing will change.

"You're crying like a little bitch" - that's just stupid.  Really stupid.
The FBI, during the Biden regime, was viewed by the majority of Americans as "Biden's Gestapo."  Instead of being eviscerated by Trump, the institution is being fucking rewarded - bigger budgets; fancy headquarters.  The budget should have been cut by 50% and the building cancelled.  Worthless bureaucrats understand that.

Federal employees CAN be fired, as Trump has proven.
The FBI is being rewarded with a bigger budget and a fancy HQ, despite all of its malfeasance.  Nothing will change.

permalinkcontextall comments (1)BREAKING - Democrats are poised to lose nearly 25 seats of representation if the Supreme Court moves forward with ending race-based gerrymandering.JohnN 1 points16 days agoI still stand by what I posted, which was said in general terms.  LA is a conservative state.  R districts are strongly R.  They can absorb the D's.  This is not the case everywhere.  The "displaced" D voters have to go somewhere.  Further, racial gerrymandering tends to create weak D Reps since they are artificially created.
permalinkcontextall comments (122)BREAKING - Democrats are poised to lose nearly 25 seats of representation if the Supreme Court moves forward with ending race-based gerrymandering.JohnN 9 points16 days agoI'm very skeptical.
In order to create a black majority district, you have to create a Dem super-majority district.  This sucks Dems out of surrounding districts, thus making these districts more likely to tip Republican.
