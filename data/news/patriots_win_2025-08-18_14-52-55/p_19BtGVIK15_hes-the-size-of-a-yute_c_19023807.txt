permalinkVlad_The_Impaler 1 points3 minutes agoComment removed by community moderators.permalinkThreaper666 16 points5 hours agoMy Cousin Vinny was my Dad's favorite movie.  Watched it a bunch when I was a kid.
permalinkthebeercules 7 points5 hours agoMarisa Tomei Is OMGWTFBBQ hot in that movie! One of my fav movies also!
permalinkConstitution_1788 3 points4 hours agoShe looked like all the hot Italian women my family and cousins hung with and I had crushes on. Love me some Italian herbs‚Ä¶
permalinkIvanDrago 3 points4 hours agoHad they spent some more time in the deep south, she would have learned to appreciate hunting culture. With all that said, she nailed the character's annoying-loveable balance.
permalinkdr_gonzo 1 points2 hours agoYa she was pretty irresistible in that flick. Which is a testament to how smoking hot she was at the time, because I am absolutely not typically attracted to the Jersey girl gaudy type with a leather jacket and tights and shit.
But she was almost too hot for the role really. Or maybe Pesci was too ugly. Either way, throughout the entire movie you're constantly thinking, "She is way the hell out of his league. No way they'd be together in real life".
A great flick though.
permalinkCombat_Hamster 16 points5 hours agoI can't keep up, did he actually show up dressed like this?
permalinkThreaper666 38 points5 hours agoNo, it's a reference to a movie.  The character in the movie can't get a real suit because the entire store was sick.  So he rents a valet outfit to court because the Judge was going to hold him in contempt for not dressing up.  The movie is called My Cousin Vinny ft. Joe Peschi, Ralph Macchio, Fred Gwen(The guy the played herman munster)  and Marrisa Tomei.
permalink556x45mm 14 points5 hours agoI love Marrisa Tomei, do you think her biological clock is still ticking?
permalinkBonusjohn28 8 points5 hours agoNope.
permalinkconservativefrank 7 points4 hours agoYou love the leftist actress who hates Trump, who after Jan 6 demanded that Congress remove him from office early?
"President Trump must be held accountable for inciting violence and enabling extremism through lies and conspiracy theories. He is a threat to democracy & American lives. Send your member of Congress a message to remove Trump from office immediately."
You love the actress who supported Kamala Harris in 2024?
You love the actress who compared efforts to remove books depicting gay sex from grammar schools to Nazi book burning?
"90 years ago TODAY, on May 10th, 1933, the Nazis burned tens of thousands of books across Germany. We must FIGHT BACK against book bans. We cannot let history repeat itself."
permalink556x45mm 5 points4 hours agoWell damn it, you just ruined her for me, thanks a lot.
There's always Kelly LeBrock, hope she isn't a libtard.
permalinkview 6 more comments...monkadelic 1 points5 minutes agoWas that Marrisa Tomei or are you talking about Alyssa Milano?
permalinkConstitution_1788 1 points4 hours agoShe‚Äôs hot, bud. As in, easy on the eyes. No one said they want a relationship with her. Hit it a quit it. You should try it sometime. It‚Äôs fun!üòÅ

permalinkImYourHuckleberry24 4 points4 hours agoStill one of my favorites. 'A Fish Called Wanda' is another favorite, even though I can't stand that bitch, Curtis. "K-K-K-K-Ken"
permalinkvegaspatriot1776 2 points43 minutes agoK-K-K-K-Ken is coming to kill me!
permalinkHawksendoom 4 points3 hours agoI wore this.. ridiculous.. thing... for you... (does hands)
permalinkBLMTrying2GetUrGuns 3 points4 hours agoPut in the context where My Cousin Vinny isn't assumed to be universally known.....making me feel old.
permalinkForceMultiplier 1 points39 minutes agoAh well, at least I remember the grits and the lard. I remember the suit now.
making me feel old.
It hit Blockbuster some time in 1992 on VHS, so yea.

TY fren, I can't believe i missed the reference!
permalinkSavingPrivateGrace 4 points5 hours agoHe showed up in some sort of military suit.  https://patriots.win/p/19BtGVIabC/-breaking-volodymyr-zelensky-fin/c
permalinkMythArcana 14 points5 hours agoThe video I just saw he was wearing a tee shirt again. If he doesn't wear a suit for the meeting, then there should be no meeting. Send them all back and send Russia whatever they need to finish the job. We tire of this.
permalinkDegenNerd 12 points5 hours agoMust be an old video you seen. He's dressed better this time. Not a 3 piece suit, but an improvement over looking like a slob like last time.
permalinkMythArcana 4 points5 hours agoThat's what I figured and commented exactly. Even this gay shrimp isn't that stupid.
permalink11GenAm 3 points5 hours agoA black jacket and a black shirt?  Is that a black tie?  Can't tell.  Or NO tie?
Susie Wiles should have stopped him at the door and said, "You are so not going in there like that ..."
permalinkDegenNerd 3 points4 hours agoHe's dressed up more than he normally is, so I'm not going to trash him over it for not wearing a 3 piece suit. At least he knows the fucking language and doesn't need a translator.
permalink11GenAm 4 points4 hours agoWhat I heard is that Putin doesn't need a translator either, but when it's important to be exact in wording, he does use one.

permalinkSavingPrivateGrace 10 points5 hours agoMy Cousin Donald!
permalinkGuidedDisinfo 7 points5 hours agoHe‚Äôs there representing the Lollipop Guild.
permalinkSomebody157 3 points5 hours agoDare I ask where the lollipop is?
permalinkGuidedDisinfo 3 points4 hours agoLet‚Äôs put it this way; nobody would be surprised if a lollipop ended up on the court at a WNBA game if Zelensky was in attendance.
permalinkUsernameChexOut 4 points5 hours agoBen missed the high heel sneakers that the clown wears to make himself look less like a dick piano playing midget
permalinkp-brane 3 points5 hours agoHe so blends
permalinkp-brane 1 points4 hours agoShort clip "oh you blend" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1xA4ItzAQ0
permalinkHurtzLocker 2 points5 hours agoJust abandon the midget in a DC ghetto (preferably ejected from a moving vehicle) and be done with it.
permalinkKarlHungus53 2 points4 hours ago"I wore this ridiculous thing, for you."
permalinkJack 2 points4 hours agoComrade, the only place that sells suits in DC was ran by illegals, and it was closed so I had to go to Lindsey Graham's place and borrow this suit.
permalinkhenri_derelicte 2 points5 hours agoHe officially wore a suit, so we can put the joke to rest
permalinkDegenNerd 2 points5 hours agoBoth he and Putin if we're being honest. Trump towers over both of those midgets.
permalinkcryptoapebot 1 points4 hours agoLove his cartoons.
permalinkTookens 1 points4 hours agoSize of a.. a what?
permalinkConstitution_1788 1 points4 hours agoGreat movie.

permalinkVlad_The_Impaler 1 points4 minutes agoTrump pretends to be opposed to zelensky but guess what?
Zelensky talks down to trump and vance and still gets his money and weapons from his American taxpayer servants.  This is because Trump talks crap but in the end his jevvv masters get what they want because they have those videos of those times Trump was Epstein's best friend.
permalinkxeriphyte2 1 points3 hours agoTwo youves
permalinkactlikewewon 1 points4 hours agoTell the half pint that we will start supplying weapons to Russia so they can remove your flag from the role call of history.  You got 48 hours.
Will the deep state shriek?  Yes, that's part of the plan.
