Chris Hansen: You may have heard that my streaming crime network TruBlu & I are investigating the exploitation of children on the popular gaming platform Roblox. Well it's absolutely true & we're deep into it. I've already interviewed law enforcement investigators & victims of this horrible activity. And we have some collaborators, some people who have been working in this space. Including Schlep who have committed to help us in this endeavor.
Schlep is the innocent guy who was banned.
Schlep (video): "I have just gotten a legal complaint from Roblox. They have sent a cease and desist letter to me and they‚Äôve gone ahead and banned every account I own. And you might be wondering, ‚ÄòWhat heinous crime did you commit to possibly deserve that?‚Äô Well, what I did was get predators arrested on their platform. Actually, six of them. I got six predators arrested within the Roblox community. Some of them, the crimes are so heinous, I can‚Äôt even say here on TikTok or wherever this is going.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd the thing that is crazy about it is that Roblox is taking a more firm action against me, a person getting these people arrested, a person that law enforcement has made public statements saying that they are glad when people like me go ahead and give them information so that they can arrest these people. Roblox has sent me the cease and desist letter, not these predators. That is absolutely insane.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd the other thing that‚Äôs crazy about this is Roblox itself is a predator haven. There are games on Roblox like XYZ Public Bathroom Simulator. It has about 7 million visits and the whole premise of the game is showering together with kids. That is the whole game. If you join it, you‚Äôre going to see predators. You‚Äôre going to see naked avatars. You‚Äôre going to see people peeing and all this sort of weird stuff."
"If I was a parent and I saw that, I would be outraged. I would be totally outraged. And parents aren't aware of this, and it's so sad. I get emails from kids daily about all the horrible stuff that they're exposed to. I get emails from parents talking about what their kids were exposed to. And there are so many predators on this platform, it is actually unreal."
"So it's quite crazy to see Roblox go after me, a person trying to get predators arrested off of their platform, than the predators! Why!? I don‚Äôt get it! I don't understand!"
Chris is going to need 7 million chairs.
Schlep: An official statement regarding Roblox:
"Schlep‚Äôs anti-predator work stems from his own traumatic experience as a Roblox user. Between ages 12 and 15, he was groomed by a prominent Roblox developer who had official company merchandise distributed nationwide and contracted directly with Roblox for platform events. The developer sent Schlep graphic violent content, pornography, and engaged in inappropriate sexual conversations."
‚ÄúWhen my client attempted suicide and was hospitalized, his mother contacted Roblox seeking help,‚Äù said Martin D. Gould, Founding Partner at SGGH. ‚ÄúRoblox was unresponsive until she threatened legal action. Only then did they engage ‚Äî and only to claim the abuse happened ‚Äòon another platform,‚Äô despite the predator being a contracted Roblox developer who the company promoted at events.‚Äù
"The developer who groomed Schlep was eventually banned from Roblox ‚Äî but only years later, after another female developer reported sexual abuse. Roblox had continued paying and promoting the predator throughout Schlep‚Äôs ordeal."

According to Brave Search we can:
To formally change or repeal the NVRA, Congress would need to pass new legislation. This would require a simple majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, meaning at least 218 votes in the House and 51 votes in the Senate.

They dream of love, possibility, and safety from danger.
As parents, it is our duty to nurture the next generation‚Äôs hope. As leaders, the responsibility to sustain our children extends beyond the comfort of a few. Undeniably, we must strive to paint a dignity-filled world for all‚Äîso that every soul may wake to peace, and so that the future itself is perfectly guarded.
A simple yet profound concept, Mr. Putin, as I am sure you agree, is that each generation‚Äôs descendants begin their lives with a purity‚Äîan innocence which stands above geography, government, and ideology.
Yet in today's world, some children are forced to carry a quiet laughter, untouched by the darkness around them‚Äîa silent defiance against the forces that can potentially claim their future. Mr. Putin, you can singlehandedly restore their melodic laughter.
In protecting the innocence of these children,  you will do more than serve Russia alone‚Äîyou serve humanity itself. Such a bold idea transcends all division, and you, Mr. Putin, are fit to implement this vision with the stroke of a pen today.
It is time.
Sincerely, Melania Trump"
