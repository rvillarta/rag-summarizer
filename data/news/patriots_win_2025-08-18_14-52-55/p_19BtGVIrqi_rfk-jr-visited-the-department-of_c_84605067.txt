permalinksola_scriptura 59 points4 hours agoLet's Go!
Have you done your pushups yet today?
If you can't do any pushups, stay in the pushup position for 90 seconds and focus on good breathing. Do this 3-5 times a day until your core strengthens enough to do some pushups!
If you're too fat for any of that... literally lay on the ground and struggle. And quit eating loads of carbs and sugars! Focus on proteins and healthful fats, and have oatmeal in the morning for fiber!
permalinkTheRedPilledArtist 20 points4 hours agoNEW GOAL
I need to at least be able to do as many pushups as my age at any given time, no matter how old I get.
I failed this time. 24/27.
permalinksola_scriptura 9 points4 hours agoI'm about to do about 20 right now, out of shape. But if I do them 3 times a day, I get to push endurance, which is always great (for both me and the ladies)
permalinkKraken_V_Algorithm 10 points3 hours agoI was on this kick a year or 2 ago, then broke the habit . . until now.  Thanks for the encouragement.  I'm 55, overweight and out of shape.  Managed to do 10 with elbows out before I started getting shaky.  Today starts my plan to do it daily again and increase when I'm able.
permalinkview 8 more comments...TheRedPilledArtist 8 points3 hours agoKeep at it, my friend! We are what we do every day. Let's not forget sit-ups! Some good core strength goes a long way, no matter the time of the day...

20 pull ups is very good.
I can knock out about 25 at one time hanging on a bar.

But I've been doing them like forever.

40 when you are 40 is THE test. Keep rocking...
I'm about to do about 20 right now, out of shape. But if I do them 3 times a day
for the second round, try adding stair pushups. Feet on the ground, one hand on step below chest level & the other even with the chest. 10 reps then switch hand positions. Keep your eyes on the top of the stairs to keep core fully lengthened & properly engaged. You will want to do more than 10 per set; you will be able to and your shoulders will love it too...

Stair pushups for you as well bud -  Sauce: I am a corrective exercise specialist.

permalinkPowerOfBlues 0 points27 minutes agoI did 75 push-ups this morning and I'm  63
permalinkGenWashington 0 points26 minutes agoI used to be able to do 100 push-ups and then 60 pull-ups.   Dang to be young again
permalinkxeriphyte2 11 points3 hours ago100 pushups a day
permalinkbrassmule 6 points3 hours ago100 sit-ups a day.
permalinkGoldenEarz 1 points2 hours ago100 burpees a day. No don’t, you’ll die.
permalinksola_scriptura 3 points3 hours agoI don't think I'd make it to 100 even if I did sets of 10, haha.
permalinkutfanx2 4 points3 hours agoSets of 10 arent bad. I do one punch man (100 pushups, 100 sit ups, 100 squats).
Put on an album and do a set of 10 each per song. Takes about a min to do all three with two minutes of rest in between.
permalinkFromTheTopRope 3 points3 hours agoIt's per-day. You could spread it out to ~5 push-ups per hour. If you were to do just 1 push-up every 10 minutes, you'd still make it. I think you have more strength than you admit.
permalinkview 1 more comments...BillsmafiaGG 2 points3 hours agoQuite easy to work up to, if you’re already nearing 20x per set.
Try a simple split like this:
17
17
16
17
17
16
That’s just six sets to get you to 100 daily. 50 in the AM, 50 right before/after lunch. Something like that. You never even have to hit 20 to build & maintain reasonable push-up strength.
permalinkcyberwar 2 points3 hours agoI did 5x50 every day before I bought a bench and weights lol
permalinkRudy_DankMemer 1 points3 hours ago
100 pushups a day
perfect for maintenance. and or warmup.
My 72 year old father is 5 foot 9 at 202 LBS and he has done 300 diamond pushups per day for for 54 years. He is the very definition of RETARD STRONG.  Should be noted that he wrecked both of his shoulders relying on that technique.
permalinktry4gain 5 points3 hours ago
If you can't do any pushups
can also make some serious strength gains using lite weight dumbbells to do shoulder / chest work
permalinksola_scriptura 4 points3 hours agoYup, all it takes is 20-pounders to get conditions to be able to do bodyweight fitness. If you're carrying a TON of body fat, though, be careful. You don't want to overstress your skeleton and injure yourself before you get in better shape for exercise.
permalinkElephant_Trump 4 points3 hours agoI'm up to 30/day. been at it for aboot a month. it's not much, but I'm already working my ass off as a tradeworker by day and a farmer and rancher by evening and weekend.
my battle is the opposite. I cannot gain. I am 5'10" 140lb if I'm lucky. I'm 45 and have live a full, fun, adventurous & high mileage life. calories in have always been deficit to calories out.

high burn rate. I need 3,500cal/day minimum. it's hard to get that much in. I get full. I do lots of shakes, fruits, nuts and LOTS raw ovine dairy throughout the day.
permalinkview 1 more comments...Aoikaze2000 3 points3 hours agoBiggest thing someone can do to help with that is fix their diet.  For example, I got an egg boiler so I can hard boil eggs and eat two of those for breakfast along with a cup of coffee, and try to avoid carbs and sugars as best as I can.
permalinkmidgetpornrocks 8 points4 hours agoWe've come a long way from Amy and her two moms.
permalinkNotYourMan 1 points1 hour agoTeach young men to do push ups and pull ups instead of teaching them to put on women's clothes and compete in women's sports.  This seems like a great idea.  Of course Joe Biden was teaching young me to become transgender women (after they got the mRNA vaccine) but RFK Jr is teaching them to exercise and enjoy being male; enjoy their testosterone.  You don't hate democrats enough!
permalinkTheRedPilledArtist 32 points4 hours agoThis is the one "challenge" I support. Put THIS on TikTok and make it go viral.
Let's see how many pushups you guys got, can you do more than me? 24.
permalinkRamblinMan67 12 points3 hours ago58 and can still hit 50. I was always good at pushups. When I was 21 in the Navy the school I was in had us doing pushups, sit-ups, burpees, a few other calisthenics, and a three mile run every Monday Wednesday and Friday. Back then 124 pushups in 2 minutes, 120 sit-ups in 2 minutes, and the 3 miler in 17 flat. But then I was 6’ and 160 pounds. Now 5’11” and 190 with a beat to death back, neck, and shoulders. Terribly out of shape, but can still knock out pushups.
permalinkNoMaskNoMaster 6 points3 hours ago3miles in 17 is insane. I remember a guy doing 6:30 on 1 mile and being the fastest in the class.
permalinkTheRedPilledArtist 1 points3 hours agoThat is incredibly impressive. You would far and away beat any of the guys I went to the academy with, I think.
permalinkTexasRoofing 1 points30 minutes agoNot bad old man.
permalinkRebooted 1 points3 hours agoNice.  Keep the healthy habits going.
Most I tested at was 90-something pushups in 2 minutes, 120-something situps in 2 minutes.  Don't remember my mile run but it was probably somewhere around 7 minutes.
permalinkBobf 1 points13 minutes agoEveryone, please do pushups properly. Straight backs, strong cores, and no flared elbows. No flared elbows, you cheaters.
permalinkTheAftermath 25 points4 hours agoPretty impressive for 71.
Pretty impressive as Health Secretary too. A truly great pick.

permalinkAstroLonghorn 6 points3 hours agoCreatine is an absolute must of course lol
permalinkLeeroyJenkins 1 points2 hours ago15-20 grams a day is what I've been using and with good success.
Between creatine and alpha GPC I've been able to quit my two energy drinks a day habit without losing clarity
permalinkgoodtimebox 2 points2 hours agoTell me more about that alpha GPC please.
permalinkParabellum76 3 points3 hours agoI remeber back in the day when the gym fudds would say it didn’t work and laugh at the idea of drinking protein shakes and creatine. Took me 15 years to convince my dad to try protein shakes
permalinkbooblitchutz 3 points3 hours agoCreatine and betaine anhydrous, if you do HIIT.
permalinkgoodtimebox 1 points2 hours agoTell me about betaine anhydrous.  Creatine and Mentzer's HIT has changed my life.
permalinkbooblitchutz 1 points1 hour agoI mean without getting into the biology of it, it works similarly to Creatine, gives you a boost for high intensity exercise. I take a creatine sup that has betaine anhydrous in it, but you can buy them separate too.
https://hugesupplements.com/blogs/content/betaine-anhydrous-benefits
permalinkgoodtimebox 1 points33 minutes agoVery interesting.  I am going to look into this.  Besides Creapure creatine, I also take Clear Muscle - Liquid HMB.  The only one on the market. Link
If your are taking regular creatine from Chyna, you might consider taking some Creapure creatine instead. It's more refined and you dont run the risk of "who knows what" fillers that the Chyna guys might put into it.  When I switched to Creapure it was like night and day. Thanks for the the tip.
permalinkTexasRoofing 1 points25 minutes agoI have some kind of reaction to creatine, tried it several times in my life and it would cause weird heart palpitations. Don’t really need it though as I am in decent shape, I do Jiu Jitsu three times a week for exercise. I think it’s important to find an active hobby if you don’t particularly enjoy a traditional gym or exercising. Dancing, biking, hiking, whatever, if it’s something you enjoy you don’t have to make yourself do it.
permalinkgoodtimebox 1 points22 minutes agoI know what you mean.  I recently picked up playing basketball after avoiding it all my life.
permalinkTexasRoofing 1 points20 minutes agoThat’s a pretty good one, you’ll definitely get a work out.

Heads  to  store get some protein powder.
For bodybuilders, whey protein powder and creatine are arguably the most important supplements. Whey protein aids in muscle repair and growth by providing essential amino acids, while creatine enhances strength, power, and muscle size by increasing ATP production in muscle cells.
Elaboration:
Whey Protein:
.
This readily absorbed protein source is a convenient way to increase your daily protein intake, which is crucial for muscle repair and growth after workouts. It delivers the necessary amino acids to stimulate muscle protein synthesis.
Creatine:
.
Creatine supplementation can increase the body's creatine stores, leading to improved strength, power, and muscle mass. It helps regenerate ATP, the primary energy source for muscle contractions, allowing for more intense and prolonged workouts.
Vitamin D:
.
While not always considered a top priority, Vitamin D is essential for overall health and plays a crucial role in muscle function and bone health, which are vital for bodybuilding. It is particularly important for those with limited sun exposure.
Omega-3 Fatty Acids:
.
These are beneficial for joint health and reducing inflammation, which can be particularly helpful during intense training.
Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs):
.
BCAAs, especially leucine, are important for muscle protein synthesis and can help reduce muscle soreness.
Caffeine:
.
While not directly related to muscle growth, caffeine can enhance performance during workouts, allowing you to train harder and potentially achieve better results

permalinkWiseDonkey 1 points2 hours agoNobody takes BCAAs seriously anymore because they won't help you build muscle without the other amino acids.  Just take your whey protein -- it has all the amino acids you need.

I'll be honest, I was happy with no girlfriends, no drama, just keeping my head down and getting ahead. Instead of being like my friends and coworkers always blowing their paychecks chasing pssy, I saved up and built up. Over time, the girls were chasing Me, buying me drinks, trying out pickup lines. They're genetically programmed to be attracted to alpha males, which is why they usually go after the "bad guys". As they age they see them for the dead end they are and look for alpha status males.
