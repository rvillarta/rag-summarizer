18 Aug, 2025 22:32 Home World News What could bring 21 million people into the streets of Iraq? They walk for days under the sun, driven by grief and resistance – turning an ancient tragedy into the world’s most powerful act of faith Arbaeen is one of the world’s most significant and massive religious events. It commemorates the tragic death of Imam Hussein – the son of Imam Ali and grandson of the Prophet Muhammad. In Iraq, Arbaeen is far more than a religious ritual. It is a powerful social, cultural, and spiritual gathering that draws millions of pilgrims from around the globe. This year, officials counted 21,103,524 arrivals. For many Shiites, the journey begins weeks before the date itself. They set out on foot from towns and cities across Iraq and from neighboring countries – primarily Iran, Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, and Lebanon. Pilgrims also come from Africa, Asia, Türkiye, Europe, and even Russia. Russians, in fact, are easy to spot: they often arrive with a giant tricolor flag. © Abbas Juma Blessing in motion An Arab proverb says: “There is blessing in movement.” In Shiite civilization, movement carries special weight. Walking forward is seen as a way of resisting decline and backsliding. That’s why the centuries-old tradition of walking the roughly 80 kilometers from Najaf to Karbala has survived – interrupted only during Saddam Hussein’s rule, when Shia Islam came under harsh political repression. As Iraqis say today: that was just a moment, and it means nothing now. “Saddam Hussein and the Baath Party waged a real war against Shiite Muslims,” recalls Sayyid Mohammad al-Yasri, head of the local branch of the Dawa Party in Najaf. We met in his spacious home, where he described life for believers under Saddam. Both he and his father had lived through years of persecution before Iraq was once again able to host millions of pilgrims each year. “The regime banned rituals, ceremonies, even prayers,” he explained. “Shiites were forbidden to travel to Karbala. That ban carried political weight, because Arbaeen has always been a symbol of the struggle for the rights of the oppressed. History remembers the ‘Arbaeen Intifada’ of 1977, when worshippers were gunned down by tanks right outside Karbala. Yet people never gave up Arbaeen. They went underground, resisted the regime, and held to their faith.” Abbas Juma and head of the local branch of the Dawa Party in Najaf Sayyid Mohammad al-Yasri © Abbas Juma “Saddam was brutal. He launched a war with Iran, poisoned Iraq’s foreign ties, and crushed his own people. We wanted to end that ourselves. But then the Americans came." “We never wanted change to come through them – it had to be the Iraqi people’s decision. We fought politically, and some of us militarily, until we finally forced the Americans out in 2011. But even then, they came back through ISIS. So Saddam is gone, but sectarian strife still plagues us. That’s the card the West plays – the US and Israel. We want unity. If our nation is united, there’s no room for Israeli aggression. Division is their goal; unity is the true path.” Scale and Organization Unlike the Hajj, in which pilgrims travel to Mecca, Arbaeen is exclusively a Shiite pilgrimage. Attendance in Karbala routinely ranges from 17 to 25 million, making it one of the largest religious gatherings on Earth. Pilgrims endure days of exhaustion, blistering heat that often tops 120°F, and all kinds of discomfort. Many believe the hardship itself is part of the test – a trial of will. Still, today’s journey is far easier than it was for their grandparents. Along the way, pilgrims are fed and given water, offered free medical care, and sheltered in tents known as mukeb. © Abbas Juma In recent years, especially since Hamas’s attack on Israel in October 2023, the Palestinian cause has become a central theme of Arbaeen. The Palestinian mukeb is more than a rest stop: it’s a museum dedicated to the Palestinian struggle and the Resistance movement. Inside are exhibits, a broadcast studio, a podcast space, a dining hall, and a clinic. For Shiites, the war in Gaza resonates deeply with the events of 680 A.D., when Hussein ibn Ali and his followers were killed in battle against the forces of Yazid ibn Muawiya. Believers see Yazid in today’s Israel and the United States, and they argue that although 1,400 years have passed, the struggle continues – an eternal battle between light and darkness, the oppressed and the oppressor, good and evil. This philosophy underpins both the Resistance movement and modern Iran’s political vision, even as the country still reels from its 12-day war with Israel. © Abbas Juma Security and sacrifice “After 2003, Iraq faced major security challenges,” says Iraqi lawyer Zaid Jabbar. “Shiite pilgrims heading to Karbala during Arbaeen were regularly attacked by suicide bombers, often from groups like al-Qaeda. They used car bombs and improvised explosives. Hundreds died each year. But after 2014, once the People’s Pilgrimage Authority was formed, the government reorganized everything and finally secured the entire route." “Even with pilgrims now arriving from Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Turkey, Russia, and Europe, security has held. Iraq spends billions providing food, water, and lodging so pilgrims can stay for free. Wealthy Iraqis donate livestock, vegetables, fruit, and sweets.” From what I saw this year, security is tighter than ever. Nobody enters Karbala without a thorough inspection. Every pocket is checked, every pill in a medicine kit examined. Just a year ago, such measures seemed impossible, and the only answer to how Iraq avoided chaos or attacks was: “by the grace of God .” © Abbas Juma Today, it’s also by the work of tens of thousands of volunteers who set aside their lives to build camps, cook meals, pour drinks, and keep order. They do it freely, out of faith, but also in hope of reward in the afterlife. You can see the joy on a volunteer’s face when you accept food from their hands — as if, in that moment, a good deed has been tallied in their favor in heaven. The tribal factor On my last day in Iraq, I visited Sheikh Amir, leader of the powerful Bani Hassan tribe, in his home. In Iraq, tribes can number in the millions, making their sheikhs wealthy and politically influential. If a tribe stretches beyond Iraq’s borders – into Saudi Arabia, for example – its leader’s influence can become regional. Q: What role do tribes play in Iraq’s political and social life? A: “The Bani Hassan and Iraq’s tribes in general are the backbone of society. They have always played an effective role in every Iraqi government. Tribes became institutions of the state – ensuring security in provinces and regions, especially when police were absent. They are closely tied to religious and political leaders. Their cohesion has been vital to Iraq’s stability. Tribes reject destructive forces, fight drugs, and support the state against terrorism. While we have our own customs, the law comes first. Anything illegal is also against tribal norms.” Sheikh Amir, leader of the powerful Bani Hassan tribe © Abbas Juma Q: What happens if a sheikh disagrees with the prime minister? A: “That has never happened. As I said, the law is supreme, and its authority extends even over the sheikhs. We live by the law.” Q: And what role do tribes play in Arbaeen? A: “A central one. The Bani Hassan tribe, in particular, has a special position because of its location on both banks of the Euphrates, near Imam Hussein’s shrine. We provide pilgrims with everything they need, day and night.” The larger picture Beyond its spiritual meaning, Arbaeen brings tangible benefits to Iraq. It strengthens Shiite identity across the region, fosters intercommunal dialogue, and, at least for a time, narrows the gap between rich and poor. Arguments are set aside, divisions blur, and people come together. In a sense, Arbaeen provides not just a religious release, but also a social one.

US President Donald Trump has named drone capabilities as a top priority for the military, with almost $5 billion allocated for naval autonomous systems in his ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ on federal spending. The Pentagon aims to arm itself with numerous unmanned boats, which cost several million dollars each and can operate in swarms without human command. The drones are seen as vital for protecting Taiwan in case of a possible military confrontation with Beijing. The program, however, has faced a series of setbacks, Reuters reported on Wednesday. It recalled an incident in July during a test off the coast of California, in which one autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) suddenly stalled and another smashed into it, vaulting over the deck and crashing back into the water. During another failed test a few weeks prior, an autonomous boat accelerated unexpectedly, capsizing its support vessel and throwing its captain overboard, Reuters reported. The captain remained unharmed, it added.

Since the latest incident, the Pentagon has indefinitely halted a contract of almost $20 million with one of the firms providing autonomous software for the vessels, sources told the agency. In May, the US Navy’s main ASV procurement unit, the Program Executive Office Unmanned and Small Combatants (PEO USC), had its chief, Rear Admiral Kevin Smith, sacked due to loss of confidence. According to Reuters’ sources, US Deputy Secretary of Defense Stephen Feinberg grilled Navy officials last month, saying he was unimpressed by some of the acquired naval drone capabilities and questioning their cost-effectiveness.

The man, referred to only as Sergey K, was detained near Rimini on the basis of a European arrest warrant. German investigators believe he led a unit that blew up sections of the pipelines in September 2022. The attacks, which ruptured both the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines in the Baltic Sea, were, improbably, initially blamed on Russian operatives. But German prosecutors later traced a rented sailing yacht to the operation and linked it to Ukrainian nationals. Read more Poland to turn wind farm into NATO’s eyes and ears – media Investigators say Sergey K was part of a group that placed explosives on the pipelines near the island of Bornholm in September 2022. The accused was allegedly one of the coordinators of the operation. He and his accomplices are said to have used a sailing yacht that departed from the German city of Rostock. The vessel had previously been rented from a German company through intermediaries using forged identification documents. “After being transferred from Italy, the accused will be brought before the investigating judge of the Federal Court of Justice,” according to the statement by the prosecutor's office. Germany’s Federal Prosecutor General has reportedly been investigating the blasts for more than two years on suspicion of sabotage and causing explosives to be detonated. The explosions were seen at the time as an attack on critical energy infrastructure and a stark example of the rising economic fallout of the Ukraine conflict. In 2023, veteran investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published a report claiming that then-US President Joe Biden had given the order to destroy Nord Stream. According to an informed source who talked to the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, the explosives had been planted by US Navy divers a few months earlier under the cover of a NATO exercise. The White House denied the report at the time, calling it “complete fiction.” You can share this story on social media: Follow RT on Dear readers!

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s plan to seize the city in order to achieve full control of Gaza was approved by the Jewish state's security cabinet two weeks ago. IDF spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin said on Wednesday that Israeli forces are already “holding the outskirts of Gaza City” and will “deepen” attacks on Palestinian armed group Hamas in the densely populated area. Netanyahu later said he had ordered the military to “shorten the timelines for seizing the last terror strongholds and for the defeat of Hamas.” The IDF is expected to present its plan for the capture of Gaza City to the prime minister on Thursday, military sources have told local media. Earlier this week, the IDF announced it would be calling up another 60,000 reservists ahead of the operation. Read more Netanyahu a ‘war hero’ – Trump Reports have also claimed that West Jerusalem has decided not to respond to Monday’s proposal by Hamas, which includes the release of ten Israeli hostages and a 60-day ceasefire. The offer was based on the framework by US President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, according to the group. Hamas said “the start of an operation against Gaza City and its nearly one million residents and displaced persons… demonstrates… a blatant disregard for the efforts made by the mediators.” On Wednesday, three IDF troops were wounded, including one severely, after 15 Hamas fighters emerged from tunnels and attacked them with firearms and anti-tank missiles near Khan Younis, south of Gaza City. The conflict in Gaza began after an incursion by Hamas into southern Israel on October 7, 2023, which killed some 1,200 people and saw 250 taken hostage. Around 50 of them remain in captivity. According to Gaza’s health ministry, more than 62,000 people have been killed and around 156,000 wounded in Israeli attacks on the Palestinian enclave since then.
