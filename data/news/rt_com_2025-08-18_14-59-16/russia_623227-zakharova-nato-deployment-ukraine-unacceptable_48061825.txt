Sergey Shoigu, secretary of Russia’s National Security Council and former defense minister, earlier warned that the arrival of NATO troops in Ukraine could trigger a third world war.In March, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron announced the establishment of a “coalition of the willing” to provide ground and air forces to monitor a potential truce or a peace deal, should Kiev and Moscow reach one.Germany, Poland, Spain, Italy, Romania and Croatia have all refused to commit their military personnel.Earlier this month, The Sunday Times quoted an anonymous UK defense official as saying that “no one wants to send their troops to die in Ukraine.”
