There will be a lot of help. Europe is the first line of defense because they are there, but we’re going to help, we’ll be involved.”Kiev has made joining NATO a central pillar of its response to the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. Despite multiple pledges from NATO state leaders, no invitation was issued.Asked about sending peacekeepers, Trump said: “We’re gonna work with Ukraine, we’re gonna work with everybody” to make sure the peace is “very long term.”Zelensky and Western European leaders are meeting with Trump and his team at the White House, days after Trump’s summit with Putin in Alaska on Friday, which both sides described as “warm” and “constructive.”
