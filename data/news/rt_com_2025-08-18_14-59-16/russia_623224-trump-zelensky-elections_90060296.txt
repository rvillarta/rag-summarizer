Trump drops wartime election quip to Zelensky
The US president joked that his country could also refuse to hold elections should it be in a state of war “with somebody”

Moscow contends that his refusal to do so means Zelensky cannot be a legitimate signatory to any binding resolution. “We need a truce to make possible democratic open and legal elections,” Zelensky responded. “During a war you can’t have elections,” he claimed.Trump picked up on it: “So, in three and a half years from now...if we happen to be in a war with somebody… no more elections.”“You like this idea,” Zelensky told the US president. In July Ukraine’s parliament prolonged martial law, which was imposed in 2022 following the escalation of the conflict with Russia, until at least November 5. Elections are prohibited under these circumstances, but while lawmakers’ terms are automatically extended, the same does not apply to the presidency.
