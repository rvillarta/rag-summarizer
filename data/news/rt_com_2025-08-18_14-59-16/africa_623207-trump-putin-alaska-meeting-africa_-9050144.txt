The Alaska summit resonates farther than you might think
The meeting between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump resonates strongly across Africa confirming that a multipolar world is possible

A propaganda narrative that poorly hides the failure of Brussel’s diplomacy reduced to blindly following Washington. Yet, the image that will remain in history is not that of a solitary Putin, but of a Russian president welcomed with full military honors in the United States, in Alaska, by Donald Trump on August 15th.A summit that, beyond its symbolism, marks a stinging humiliation for the EU and announces a shift in the global balance of power.Russia isolated?Since February 2022, Brussels has multiplied “punitive” sanctions against Moscow. Seventeen successive packages, often absurd, even targeting African activists such as such as Nathalie Yamb and myself, accused of denouncing Western interference and defending Russian-African cooperation. Meanwhile, Russia has consolidated its partnerships with the BRICS, expanded its trade with Asia, strengthened its presence in the Middle East, and built durable alliances in Africa.Putin’s arrival in Alaska definitively demolishes the myth of “isolation.” The real world is not the one described on European talk shows. In reality, Moscow is engaged in dialogue with New Delhi, Beijing, Tehran, Brasilia, Pretoria, and numerous African capitals. And now, the Kremlin is back at the center of the American stage, driven by Trump.

Red carpet rolled outThe scene will remain unforgettable. The Russian Air Force One landing on American soil. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov appearing in a sweatshirt emblazoned with “USSR,” an intentional nod to history and Russia’s collective memory. Then the most striking image: Vladimir Putin, personally welcomed by Donald Trump on a red carpet, as F-22s and a stealth B-2 Spirit bomber symbolically flew overhead.A protocol that even Washington’s traditional allies no longer enjoy. Where Macron, Merz, or von der Leyen are received with distance, Putin was treated as a true head of state one whose presence commands respect and gravity. At the close of the press conference, the meeting produced an exchange that speaks volumes about the atmosphere:Donald Trump: “We’ll speak to you very soon and probably see you again very soon. Thank you very much, Vladimir”.Vladimir Putin, in English: “Next time in Moscow.”“Oh, that’s an interesting one,” Trump replied. “I’ll get a little heat for that one. But I could see it possibly happening.”This brief exchange highlights the fundamental difference with European leaders: here, no condescension, no paternalism, no empty threats. Just two leaders assuming their responsibilities, seeking pragmatic solutions, aware that the future is decided between great powers not in the corridors of Brussels.

Brussels and Kiev as spectatorsThe message is crystal clear. While the European Union believed itself to be indispensable in managing the Ukrainian crisis, it was not even invited. The Alaska summit took place without it without its diplomats, without its arrogant commissioners, without its pseudo-peace initiatives that were never credible.The EU is in decline: diplomatically, economically, strategically. It clings to a subordinate role, piling up sanctions and bellicose rhetoric, hoping to exist through endless wars. But in reality, Washington has never considered Brussels a strategic partner, only a docile executor. The Trump-Putin meeting is glaring proof of this.This diplomatic shift now puts Ukraine in a corner. Trump has been clear: he wants to end the war launched by the Biden administration, which turned Kiev into a proxy against Moscow. The United States has no interest in prolonging a long and costly war that undermines its economy and fuels internal divisions.Zelensky’s image has crumbled amid scandals and growing international fatigue. Despite the veneer of respect and lionization given to him by Western public figures, he finds himself with little real power to decide anything, even when it concerns his own country, now that even Washington is preparing to move on from him. Trump knows perfectly well that Zelensky’s Ukraine is just a pawn and that the bill must be settled.Putin’s diplomacyAnother key takeaway from this summit is Vladimir Putin’s diplomatic stature. In the midst of a military operation in Ukraine, despite relentless demonization campaigns, he has imposed himself as the man with whom great powers must reckon.His strategy is clear: extend a hand to Trump to build a framework for cooperation, emphasize the natural neighborhood between Russia and the United States via Alaska, and propose an honorable way out of the Ukrainian crisis. Putin plays the pragmatism card, investing in time and patience while the EU persists in ideology, russophobia, and moralizing postures.Unsurprisingly, CNN and other Atlanticist media tried to distort reality. According to them, Trump was “humiliated” by Putin. But the images circulating on social media speak for themselves: two men smiling, shaking hands, visibly satisfied with their meeting.Western propaganda tries to turn every gesture into conflict, every handshake into confrontation. But the truth is simple: Russia and the United States, at a strategic level, are closer to an agreement than NATO-aligned propagandists are willing to admit.Brussels would do well to meditate on this lesson. Washington has never saved its allies. From Kabul to Baghdad, from Saigon to Kiev, the White House always abandons those who believe they can rely on it. Americans know they cannot afford a direct war against the Russian army, supported by a people hardened and seasoned by history.

The Alaska summit marks a turning point. It reveals an undeniable truth: global diplomacy is now being shaped without Europe. Under Trump, the United States may well reestablish ties with Moscow to end a useless and ruinous war. Putin emerges from this meeting stronger than ever, proving he was never isolated and remains the most respected and formidable head of state on the world stage.As for the EU, it finds itself exposed to a posture of mere spectator, humiliated by its own illusions. Its blind obedience to Washington has led it to a dead end. Russia, meanwhile, continues to move forward. And history will remember that in Alaska, two men opened a path toward peace leaving the European warmongers behind.How Africans see itThe Alaska summit has been perceived by many Africans as a revealing moment about the true nature of global power relations. What emerges is a fundamental truth: on the world stage, power only recognizes and respects power.Russia, through its sovereignty, military capability, and the firmness of its leadership, compelled Washington to treat it as an equal. Normally, the United States imposes its will through threats, interference, or military force. But in the case of Russia, a major nuclear power led by a patriot, Washington restrains itself and dares not employ its usual methods.

For Africans, this event is more than a simple diplomatic episode: it embodies both a moral victory and a political lesson. It shows that only genuine independence, backed by economic, political, and military strength, can command respect in international affairs.This is why the summit resonates so strongly across Africa. It confirms that Western domination is not inevitable and that a multipolar world is possible. Seeing Russia stand firm inspires hope that, one day, a united and sovereign Africa will also be able to command respect and defend its interests with dignity.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.Opinion
