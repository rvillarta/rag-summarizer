Hungary’s relations with Ukraine have been steadily deteriorating in recent years, with Budapest accusing Kiev of discriminating against the Hungarian ethnic minority in Western Ukraine.In a post on X on Monday, Szijjarto stated that while “Russia has supplied oil to Hungary for decades via the Druzhba pipeline,” Ukraine “attacks this pipeline, and because of these Ukrainian strikes, oil supplies to Hungary are repeatedly cut off.” The diplomat stressed that Kiev’s actions go directly against his country’s national interests.Szijjarto went on to warn Kiev that a “significant part of Ukraine’s electricity comes from Hungary…”The remark came in response to a statement by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrey Sibiga. In an X post earlier on Monday, Sibiga wrote that “Hungary has made every effort to maintain its reliance on Russia,” even after the Ukraine conflict escalated in February 2022, and despite being “told for years that Moscow is an unreliable partner.”

“You can now send your complaints – and threats – to your friends in Moscow,” Sibiga told Szijjarto.In an earlier message, the Hungarian official claimed that the “outrageous and unacceptable” Ukrainian attack on the conduit was part of concerted efforts by Kiev and Brussels to “drag Hungary into the war in Ukraine.” The previous attack on Druzhba happened as recently as last week.Druzhba is one of the world’s longest networks, transporting crude some 4,000km (2,485 miles) from Russia and Kazakhstan to the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia.Commenting on the latest attack on the pipeline, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova suggested that the current Ukrainian leadership poses a threat to all neighboring nations, with Moscow having repeatedly warned about that since the 2014 Western-backed Maidan coup.
