Zelensky and his Western European backers had previously said that there could be no peace without a ceasefire first.Zelensky and several West European leaders are meeting with Trump and his team at the White House to discuss a possible resolution to the Ukraine conflict. Trump met with Putin in Alaska on Friday in a historic summit which both sides described as “warm” and “constructive.”Zelensky’s last visit to the White House ended in disgrace, after he was accused of being disrespectful and told by the Trump that “he does not hold the cards.” This time he is wearing a dark suit but no tie.
