Trump wants Ukraine to make territorial concessions – media
After talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the US leader reportedly thinks Kiev should agree to cede the whole of Donbass to Moscow
US President Donald Trump. ©                 Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesUS President Donald Trump has endorsed a peace plan that envisages Ukraine ceding the whole of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics to Russia, the New York Times and Fox News have claimed, citing anonymous European officials. Moscow would then supposedly agree to cease hostilities elsewhere.The reports came in the wake of Trump’s meeting with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in Anchorage, Alaska on Friday. Following the talks, the two presidents expressed hope that progress had been made toward a resolution of the Ukraine conflict.On Saturday, the NYT quoted its sources as saying that during the upcoming meeting with Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky and several Western European leaders at the White House on Monday, Trump will propose that Kiev relinquish the areas of the new Russian territories in Donbass still under Ukrainian control. The Kremlin, in turn, would agree to cease hostilities along the current front line in Zaporozhye and Kherson regions, which also became part of Russia after referendums in 2022.

Around the same time, Fox News quoted an unnamed European diplomat as suggesting that the arrangement had been proposed by President Putin during the Alaska summit, and that “President Trump supports the terms.”Zelensky has repeatedly ruled out any territorial concessions to Moscow.Speaking to CNN on Sunday, President Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, claimed that Moscow had “made some [territorial] concessions” in what he described as a “significant” shift toward “moderation.” According to the US official, the current front line would serve as the basis for “land swapping” in at least some areas.The Kremlin has yet to comment on the supposed new territorial arrangements. As of Sunday, Moscow still officially insists that Ukraine recognize Crimea, the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, and the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions as Russian territory in their entirety, and withdraw its troops from their administrative borders.
