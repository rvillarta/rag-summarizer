Moscow reacts to Ukrainian attack on key oil pipeline to EU
Russia has long warned about the global spread of Kiev’s malevolent acts, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zakharova has said

Szijjarto suggested that the “outrageous” attack was an attempt by Kiev and its supporters in Brussels to drag Budapest, which has maintained its neutrality, into the conflict.Zakharova commented on Telegram that since the Western-backed coup in Ukraine in 2014, “Russia has been warning the ideologues nurturing the Kiev regime… that this monster – immoral and bloodthirsty – will never stop and will spread like a nasty infection all over the world.”The Ukrainian authorities “have already committed terrorist attacks in Africa. They have shown up in the Middle East. They have drawn citizens of Central Asia into terrorism. In Europe, they have mastered the black arms market. They got into the illegal organ trade for its Western customers,” she wrote.
