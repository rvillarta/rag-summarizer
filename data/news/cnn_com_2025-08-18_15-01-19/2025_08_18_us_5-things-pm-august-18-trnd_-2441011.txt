👋 Welcome to 5 Things PM! Now’s a good time to pick up some Powerball tickets. The jackpot for Monday night’s drawing just passed $600 million — the biggest so far this year. No one has won since the end of May.
Here’s what else you might have missed during your busy day.

Arkansas Department of Corrections
1️⃣ ‘Devil in the Ozarks’
Grant Hardin, a one-time police chief, evaded authorities for more than 10 days in the rocky terrain and dense vegetation of rural northwest Arkansas. His prison escape plan, hatched over several months, included Sharpie markers and a handmade badge.

2️⃣ One-stop shopping
Americans started their back-to-school shopping earlier this year, worried that tariffs would raise prices. Families looking for deals on sneakers and laptops are finding them in a less traditional place — and at a fraction of the cost of major retailers.
3️⃣ Crypto boom
This summer has been one to remember for cryptocurrency. A growing number of enthusiastic investors are embracing it — spurred in large part by White House support and sweeping legislative changes in Washington.
4️⃣ Life after a disaster
The once-thriving Roman city of Pompeii resembles an eerie time capsule, seemingly unoccupied since a catastrophic volcanic eruption in AD 79 buried everything under a blanket of ash. But new findings reveal a little-known postscript.
5️⃣ Building bonds
Do people cancel plans with you at the last minute, flake out for no good reason or just go MIA? It could be because you’re a bad friend.
