278 Raise your kids right. 🔥🗑️ ️ GARBAGE PEOPLE 🗑️🔥 posted 4 hours ago by blue5707 11 comments suzy @Suzy_1776 • 13h We have a seven year old entrepreneur in our neighborhood. He put out flyers and everything. He rolls your garbage can to the curb the night before trash pick up & rolls it back to your garage once it’s picked up. We of course signed up for this service & we pay him $5 a week. 11 comments R3Dpill 6 points 2 hours ago I just made the same deal $5 with my neighbors kid. They are thrilled to earn money. permalink bill_in_texas 1 points 9 minutes ago Good friends of mine, the wife is complaining about the husband being a procrastinator, and one of her complaints was that the husband wouldn't take the garbage out. She was fixated on that. I told her to pay a neighbor kid to do it, just like this story. For a few bucks a week, that terribly important issue could be solved and over with. She chose to leave the husband, a guy with a good job, a good family man, who helped raise good kids, instead. I don't get it. permalink Bandanna1 1 points 2 minutes ago Lol my wife never closes a fucking cabinet. Guess I'll get a divorce. permalink Choomguy 5 points 3 hours ago Good forthe kid, but that seems a little steep permalink NoFalseSong 9 points 2 hours ago The eternal boomer permalink UncleSlayton 8 points 1 hour ago $5 today = $1 in 2000 permalink The_Return_of_User_x 5 points 1 hour ago He doesn't have insurance either! Gasp!! permalink Bobf 3 points 54 minutes ago What are you doing living in a house if you cant afford 5 dollars for VIP trash bin service. permalink MarshallB 4 points 2 hours ago How many days a week do you get a pickup? I get it one day a week now after twice a week for decades (and before wheels on garbage cans or luggage) permalink DJTJ2024 2 points 2 hours ago Ugh, just another subscription service to deal with! What happens if I forget to cancel? Will he still take out my garbage when he's 35? permalink bill_in_texas 3 points 14 minutes ago Hi, this is Columbi1a House records. We note in our files that you still need to purchase two records from us to fulfill your contractual agreement to buy 10 albums from us, in exchange for your initial purchase of 13 albums for 1 cent. Thank you for your attention to this matter. permalink 278 Raise your kids right. 🔥🗑️ ️ GARBAGE PEOPLE 🗑️🔥 posted 4 hours ago by blue5707 11 comments suzy @Suzy_1776 • 13h We have a seven year old entrepreneur in our neighborhood.
