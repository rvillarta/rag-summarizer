269 You abused your security clearance by bad mouthing the President while having your clearance. You have been badmouthing him for years. Now you don’t have a clearance. You signed the 2019 letter. Everything I said is accurate. Enjoy losing your Kentucky Senate race too, loser. posted 5 hours ago by PiratePatriotParrot PRO 13 comments Laura Loomer @LauraLoomer • 12h You abused your security clearance by bad mouthing the President while having your clearance.

Joel Willett @realJoelWillett • 12h Fact Check: I didn't have a security clearance in 2019. You can't "abuse" something you don't have. One hell of a scoop, Laura. 13 comments Belleoffreedom 5 points 4 hours ago So, who's lying here? It's hard to tell. permalink SanityGumby 15 points 2 hours ago He is. He had a security clearance. And it was revoked yesterday. So he is lying. permalink COLDWARPATRIOT55 4 points 16 minutes ago Laura is rarely wrong. She researches down to the last speck of dust on most people. permalink Tookens 3 points 4 hours ago "That depends on what the meaning of 'is' is." permalink PatPede1 2 points 4 hours ago Both? That seems to be the most likely answer in political circles. permalink SqRt7744 -3 points 2 hours ago Probably both to a greater or lesser degree. I don't know or care about Willett, but I know Loomer is a liar. permalink SqRt7744 -13 points 2 hours ago Loomer is a worthless israel firster. Her latest big success was sucessfully getting her controlled puppet Rubio to deny special medical treatment visas for Palestinian kids with serious injuries / medical conditions that can't be treated in razed gaza. Yay!? Gtfooh you psycho bitch. permalink SanityGumby 10 points 2 hours ago Go back to India faggot permalink Ligersrule1 2 points 2 hours ago Fuck ALL semites! permalink thisperson 1 points 5 minutes ago We don’t have UHC or whatever free healthcare is here in the US. That pissed you off for some reason? Some faggot’s bill of virtue signaling not getting into the grift. permalink 269 You abused your security clearance by bad mouthing the President while having your clearance.
