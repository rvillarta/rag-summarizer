Idiots here need to stop being high on hopium and come back to reality and understand all this is just theater. It's a never ending movie with no valuable end result. permalink Metriz77 1 points 9 hours ago So is arresting people on dumb charges. Just because Dems do it, doesn‚Äôt mean we need to. Bigger fish to fry. And if you think lower taxes, huge incoming tariff revenue, the most secure border ever and illegal alien sex deviants being arrested are just theatrics then you got your head up your ass and really don‚Äôt care about this country. permalink imbackbish 0 points 14 hours ago COOL.

Supposed to be the other way around. permalink TheTruthAlwaysWins 2 points 14 hours ago I don't think we will see major names indicted/arrested until midterms are over. And when you think it through based on scope and size, what Trump is doing is logical. Who still has power to keep stallling the MAGA agenda? All dems are globalists, or just sellouts for money. Same with the repubs/neo-cons/rhinos. This is an ongoing conspiracy, and Pam is using "Grand Conspiracy" to go after them. Of the 535 on the hill, you'd be hard pressed to find 35 that are not criminals. They have to be eliminated. We still have some hard battles ahead of us. From ChatGPT: A conspiracy is simply when two or more people secretly plan to do something illegal or harmful. It doesn‚Äôt need to be big‚Äîit could be a small group planning a scam, a cover-up, or even just lying together for personal gain. The key idea is secrecy and coordination. A Grand Conspiracy is usually used to describe a much larger, often global or society-wide plot. Instead of a handful of people, it involves the belief that powerful groups‚Äîgovernments, corporations, secret societies‚Äîare all working together behind the scenes. It‚Äôs less about one crime and more about an ongoing, all-encompassing hidden agenda. permalink HKgoneWild 0 points 11 hours ago They're 2 more weeks-ing us.

SAME DAY JUDGE DENIES RELEASING EPSTEIN FILES. STOP DEFENDING PEDOPHILES. permalink NotYourMan 1 points 13 hours ago Arrests? We realize that it takes time to gather the evidence but only if you are on Trump's team. Obama and Hillary got together neutral FBI agents without any evidence and they raided Trump's house with the shoot to kill order too! Why do democrats like Hillary have more courage then Trump's team? Get out there and start arresting people; put those agents in the raid in jail. Where is the f*cking Jan 6th bombers? Why is this person not in jail? permalink NonbinaryPotatohead 1 points 12 hours ago He works for Palantir now, like they all do. permalink Sanjyuuichi3 1 points 14 hours ago All I heard and all I've been hearing from them since election day is "We will find you. We will get away with it." Accountability means facing the consequences of your actions. A slap on the wrist doesn't mean diddly for accountability. permalink JerryNadlerBeltFund 44 points 15 hours ago Has anyone told him that the FBI that he leads is, in fact, a law enforcement organization, capable of making arrests? permalink Here_we_go 17 points 15 hours ago He's busy picking out paint colors and furniture for the new fbi building he was going to disband day 1 permalink JerryNadlerBeltFund 9 points 15 hours ago The Deep State Museum guests will appreciate that! permalink The_Emperor 2 points 11 hours ago I don't know about you, but have you seen the list posted here of criminals from the Deep state? It's over 50 names. Heads of agencies, politicians, Democrat operators,. And EVERY ONE OF THESE CRIMINALS has left a faint paper trail, a faint digital trail...a faint financial trail. And this web has MANY Queens of the Demonweb pits. I for one am patient. Patient as the Count of Monte Cristo. And when we get our Justice, it will burn the nest of evil to its core. This isn't one crime family. It's the entire globalist Mafia. The evidence is being built, some are talking for immunity. We will see our pound of flesh, can't. it is far more than 2 weeks. I can sleep soundly. The spiders cant. permalink RiolindasReturn 2 points 14 hours ago But ‚Äúthey‚Äôve been removed from leadership positions‚Äù!!!

The idea of People attacking Trump actually being held accountable? That's rich. permalink BlackPilledMAGA 8 points 15 hours ago I hope bringing in an assistant deputy director means that Kash is about to be fired and replaced by Bongino. permalink RiolindasReturn 4 points 15 hours ago Bongino wouldn‚Äôt be any better, I‚Äôm afraid. More like bring in a deputy who can then be acting director when Kash is exited. permalink BidenShowerDrool 4 points 14 hours ago Every time i see Bongino talk it's like he's held hostage and he's very cagey with his words.

A: 'We are trying to find out in the dept who they are?' Kash - just close down the entire FBI.... you know it... I know it... everyone knows.
