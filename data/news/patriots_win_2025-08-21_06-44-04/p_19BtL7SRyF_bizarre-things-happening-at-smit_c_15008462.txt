This is why the pendulum is swinging back to the right. No one with a stake in a strong, functioning society wants this. permalink Gigigurrlll 5 points 4 hours ago 100% agree! Exactly the right words to describe what is happening today. My word choice, "The patients are running the asylum." permalink sleepinggiant 4 points 2 hours ago If you go back to why homosexuality is a mental illness that shit made way more sense than this shit trying to claim its not. permalink lifeisahologram 9 points 2 hours ago Museum Guide: “Here we have a section honoring David Homo” 😊 Guest: “What did he do” 🤨 Museum Guide: “He was the first black gay transsexual radio operator” 😃 Guest: “so you’re honoring him because he is the first radio operator to stick his penis inside an asshole?” Museum Guide: “No!” 😡 Guest: “Well he wasn’t the first ever radio operator, so what are you honoring him for?” 🤔 Museum: “well, we’re honoring him….for…being the first…. radio operator to stick his penis inside an asshole…” 😬 permalink Oback_Barama 2 points 51 minutes ago …And next is Lance Fagsmith. He’s the first gay black Midget radio operator. permalink Duce30 7 points 3 hours ago Sapphist, hijra and friend of Dorothy? WTF is this shit? Actually I dont want to know cause im sure its fucked up. Disgusting. Better question is why is the Smithsonian even entertaining this garbage? Time to fired the woke retards running it! permalink CasuallyObservant 4 points 4 hours ago Insanity. Idiocracy. We must right this listing ship! permalink CloudNine 4 points 2 hours ago I had to look it up- Friend of Dorothy is a term for a gay man, derived from the character Dorothy Gale of the Oz series or the actress Judy Garland. The term was used to avoid hostility and express solidarity in the 20th century, and has connections to queer subtext, rainbow flag, and Judy Garland's life. permalink 24601 1 points 2 minutes ago Rule 1: Gay should no longer be used to describe a homosexual. Let's call it what it is.... Homosexuality. permalink Antenna 3 points 2 hours ago WTF is "mahu"? permalink Perseverant 2 points 46 minutes ago It's what you say when you're fat and you sneeze. permalink indigo_truther 2 points 1 hour ago So glad I don't know most of these permalink Captain92 2 points 60 minutes ago You solved world hunger, create technological marvels, and saved millions of lives. That's what people care about. Not how much cock you take up the butt from your boyfriend named Larry. In fact, we could really care less. permalink goat_nebula 2 points 59 minutes ago Gender-Bender and Friend of Dorothy. I feel like some of these weirdos are the punch line to a bad prank and just have no clue. permalink eclectic22 2 points 4 hours ago They are mocking us. permalink eclectic22 2 points 4 hours ago Invert? Pervert! permalink Trumptrooper23 2 points 1 hour ago Urning??? permalink Perseverant 1 points 45 minutes ago Desiring to be cremated. permalink tt777 1 points 3 hours ago Disgusting. permalink Herpawinski 1 points 32 minutes ago They should have their own little museum so nobody else has to see that shit. permalink Perseverant 1 points 47 minutes ago "We get it, we get it. You have 20 different ways to say pervert." permalink Tophat9000 1 points 30 minutes ago Friends of Dorothy? That's a thing? permalink ConductProbation 1 points 2 hours ago So... now the most important US history and meaning is defined as perverts and slavery. Got it. permalink Mungo 1 points 13 minutes ago “Friend of Dorothy???” permalink DJTJ2024 1 points 2 hours ago Dafuq is a mahu? permalink Herpawinski 1 points 28 minutes ago A word invented to make people ask "What is a mahu?" so they can fill your head with some invert propaganda bullshit. They obviously make up words just so that people will look them up. permalink OftenDisgusted 1 points 39 minutes ago The Smithsonian needs to be heavily sprayed with DEI-LIB-Nitwit disinfectant. permalink 204 Bizarre things happening at Smithsonian. posted 4 hours ago by kinbergfan 27 comments Rapid Response 47 @RapidResponse47 • 18h The Smithsonian's "LGBTQ+ History" includes "lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, transgender, queer, transsexual, transvestite, mahu, homosexual, fluid, invert, urning, third sex, two sex, gender-bender, sapphist, hijra, friend of Dorothy, drag queen/king, and many other experiences." 🤨
