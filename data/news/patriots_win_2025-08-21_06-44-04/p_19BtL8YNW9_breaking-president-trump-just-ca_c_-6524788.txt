CO you have been warned, once DJT uses all capitals, you know you ran out of time permalink cwoalf3 5 points 1 hour ago 2 weeks? permalink NotYourMan 3 points 1 hour ago The case against Tina Peters is more lawfare by democrats against innocent citizens. We didn't notice that democrats created tyranny until vaccine mandates but that is what we had. The slow conquest of the people by democrats over time using millions of regulations and laws that remove individual liberty. This is California projected onto the entire country and the world during COVID. De-banking, getting fired for rejecting the COVID clot shot, getting censored on private social media accounts, MSM constantly pushing the democrat agenda, transgender brain washing everywhere. It was tyranny by Joe Biden's autopen but mostly democrat's implementing liberal fascism on the people. permalink finnigan 2 points 59 minutes ago I wonder why he hasn't pardoned her. permalink bill_in_texas 7 points 55 minutes ago She was convicted in a STATE kangaroo court, not a federal court. Trump can't pardon state crimes, even if the charges were false to begin with. What he needs to do is start arresting Colorado officials on FEDERAL charges, then offer up a hostage trade. permalink d003 2 points 6 minutes ago i like your tactic, but instead of a hostage trade, put the seditious colorado politicians under a noose, declare their state judicial system corrupted by fraud, and tina peters automatically goes free. permalink 139 BREAKING: President Trump just called for Tina Peters RELEASE!
