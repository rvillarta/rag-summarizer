(Rebel flag) permalink Tongs_Ya_Bass 13 points 49 minutes ago Thousands of flags going up across the country, they’ve clearly taken a leaf out of the Ulster Loyalists book, they’ve got their flags up 24/7 365.

Its not the symbol of sacrifice its the executioner using intimidation. permalink Coprolite -4 points 32 minutes ago Aktually, a cross isn't Christian unless it's got a dead Hebrew nailed to it. permalink Made_in_America 4 points 13 minutes ago Jesus started life as a Jevv but rejected Judaism to the point of creating a replacement religion based on the recurring theme throughout the New Testament; “don’t be like the Jevvs”. As the founder of Christianity he died the glorious King of anti-semitism and is beloved across the earth for teaching us all to not be like the Jevvs. permalink Donold 1 points 24 minutes ago The (northern) cross is a navigational aid used to cross the ocean. "And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years" You can use the northern cross for direction, season and time. permalink 24601 1 points 7 minutes ago That's wrong... of course... The crucifix is a Catholic symbol. The bare cross is used by most other Christian sects, since the image of Christ on the cross is considered idolatry. However, there are multiple religions and cults which venerate some sort of cross symbol. permalink 437 Oi yu hoive a loicence for that?! 🚫 1984 🚫 posted 1 hour ago by dirtysanchez69 12 comments
