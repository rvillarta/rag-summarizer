"Why is our government attacking immigrants? Derp?!" permalink user2827 6 points 9 hours ago The only issue with this one is that people don't often "document" their houseguests. A better equivalent is bank robbers are just making undocumented withdrawals. permalink TheMemesofProduction 5 points 9 hours ago We are so back.

They are definitionally migrants, while immigrant means not-migrant. They are also not undocumented, unless they committed felony improper entry. It is a completely improper term. permalink I-am-Orlando OP PRO 5 points 10 hours ago Link https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1958185007760970233 permalink GuerillaYourDreams 5 points 9 hours ago THIS.

Someone will rubber stamp it eventually, go back to sleep. permalink Dangerous 2 points 7 hours ago next thing you know you will be calling burglars "undocumented houseguests" That joke is a decade and a half old at this point... and also already happened in reality, since illicit squatters have been given legal protection is several states for years now... permalink BeholdaPaleHorse 1 points 8 hours ago Cool, now do Israelis permalink knnbccb 1 points 4 hours ago Why not just kill them?

There are also no illegal aliens, alien invaders, militant invaders, paperless immigrants, asylum seekers or anything similar. We have only American citizens and temporary work visas, student visas and visitor visas. The criminal prisoners that were not executed will be deported as the prison terms end, permalink MarshallB 1 points 1 hour ago I consider an undocumented immigrant a LEGAL immigrant who does not have his documentation on his person. Using this term for foreign invading ALIENS is like bait and switch. permalink 1063 Homeland Security: ‚ÄúUndocumented immigrant‚Äù is the immigration equivalent of ‚Äúthey/them.‚Äù posted 10 hours ago by I-am-Orlando PRO 48 comments
