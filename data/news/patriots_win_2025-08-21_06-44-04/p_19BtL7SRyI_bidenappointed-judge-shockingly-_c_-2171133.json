    "article_summary": "A Biden-appointed judge has ruled that children of foreign diplomats are not automatically granted U.S. citizenship, based on the 14th amendment's exemption for foreign dignitaries. This decision was supported by previous cases such as Hoda Muthana's, where her birthright citizenship was denied due to her father being a Yemeni diplomat at the time.</s>"
