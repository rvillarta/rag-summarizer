CA leftist officials keep shuffling the votes around until they get a result they like. It is a rats' nest of thieving demons who all must be changed out---or, and this is the case--eliminated altogether once we have in place quantum voting from personal phones/computers. It's coming soon. ~ 21 Aug 2025 permalink permissible_missile 16 points 3 hours ago quantum voting Apex cringe permalink Meister_Bockmist 8 points 2 hours ago Listen, Jack, I order my quantum pizza from my quantum phone, and i get my Schr√∂dinger's with extra cheese and a cat in the box. permalink westrock2000 2 points 44 minutes ago The news told me it is debunked conspiracy theory that people are eating cat pizzas. permalink Side_o_beef_curtains 5 points 3 hours ago Can confirm. I grew up in California. It is common for districts to have 125% of registered voters cast a ballot on election night in areas that are not as far left. permalink yuio4344 5 points 3 hours ago The CIA, FBI and the other 16 Intel Agencies protected Epstein' / M0ssad / lsraeIi government's Congressional extortion child f*ck honeypot for over 20 years. We may never know what percentage of our Congress became Benjamin Netanyahu's puppets.

This is the last step and that step involves no voter ID, ballot box stuffing, ballot harvesting. Its always the same with democrats after they conquer a city or state. permalink DCPower 2 points 1 hour ago Please support Mike Lindell of MyPillow to fight for election integrity!

Disabled, military, overseas? Too bad. permalink FuckU/Spez 11 points 3 hours ago Almost every country has a consulate or embassy. Go vote there in person. That's what other countries do. I don't trust the disabled vote.

I need to be able to mail it! we've seen that US postal workers now go through ballots and dump the ones from opponents. when you put it in ANY mail, even US mail, you're destroying chain of custody. permalink glow-operator-2-0 3 points 1 hour ago Union soldiers were trained / shipped to their registered counties to vote in 1864. It can be done then, it can certainly be done now. Sounds like a lack of will to me. permalink Svaap 0 points 54 minutes ago You mean campaign flyers?

I didn't open mine since I planned to vote in person, so they said my vote would take 2 weeks or so to be counted. permalink DCPower 4 points 1 hour ago Please support Mike Lindell of MyPillow to fight for election integrity!

That's what democracy is. Now he can run around and say, "Hey, the people voted for this, Im just doing what the people want" ;) . . . permalink glow-operator-2-0 2 points 1 hour ago People voted for Prop 13 in 1978 and against a later Prop 5 (2020s) that would undo Prop 13.

And yet basically everywhere they've been adopted the counting process is slower and more prone to error. permalink hazelknut 2 points 3 hours ago sadly, it tells you that they got all the votes they needed in one night. permalink DCPower 0 points 1 hour ago Please support Mike Lindell of MyPillow to fight for election integrity!
