    "article_summary": "Iraq is experiencing its worst drought in nearly a century, causing a humanitarian crisis in Basra, a vital port city. The Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, which flow into the Persian Gulf, have seen their levels drop due to poor rainfall and upstream water restrictions.

Experts warn that the water crisis will worsen without urgent government action.</s>"
