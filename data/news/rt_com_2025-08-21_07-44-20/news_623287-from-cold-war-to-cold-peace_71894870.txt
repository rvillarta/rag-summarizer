They come to the northernmost corner of the United States with a curious observation in mind: behind the cold surface and icy serenity of its wilderness, America’s only Arctic state offers a striking paradox. Beneath the frost lies a warmth and hospitality that reveals itself to anyone willing to look deeper – into the land and into the lives of the people who call it home. The same paradox applies to the recent US–Russia summit in Anchorage. At first glance, the meeting between the two presidents looked distant, almost sterile, with no headline-grabbing agreements or breakthroughs. But look closer, and the encounter appears warmer and more constructive – less about optics, more about substance. For relations long shaped by the Cold War, the iceberg metaphor holds: what’s visible above the surface is only a fraction of the mass beneath the waterline. A quick scan of the headlines might suggest that the hastily arranged summit, its agenda rewritten on the fly, produced little of value. No signed deals, no grand announcements. But in fact, it marked the first in-person meeting between the leaders of the two nuclear superpowers since 2021. That alone was enough to thaw long-frozen channels of communication – and may well provide the prologue to a series of bilateral and multilateral talks between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump aimed at tackling the toughest items on the global agenda. Read more The old world order cracked in Alaska For the ice to begin cracking, both Moscow and Washington had to overcome a mutual estrangement rooted in years of mistrust and the absence of direct dialogue. The Russian delegation feared the summit was little more than a stage set for Trump to score headlines and angle for a Nobel Peace Prize. Trump, meanwhile, was wary of reigniting the old narrative of his alleged ties to Moscow – a storyline that haunted him after his 2020 election loss, dogged him through lawsuits, and shadowed him even after he survived an assassination attempt during the 2024 campaign. It was with that history in mind that Putin opened the meeting with a pointed greeting: “Good afternoon, dear neighbor. Glad to see you in good health – and alive.” Trump, careful not to be seen as overly chummy with his Russian counterpart, tweaked the protocol. Instead of greeting Putin at the plane, he orchestrated a simultaneous red-carpet walkout on the tarmac at Elmendorf–Richardson Air Force Base. In the summit sessions he declined a one-on-one, replacing it with a “three-on-three” format: Sergey Lavrov and Yury Ushakov on the Russian side, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff on the American. The move shielded Trump from accusations that, left alone with Putin, he would cave. Still, the two men did get a private exchange – inside Trump’s car en route to the talks. The discussions themselves were brisk, barely two hours instead of the planned six or seven. The working lunch was scrapped. Even the press conference broke protocol: Putin spoke first, and at length – two and a half times longer than the summit’s host. Unsurprisingly, the media spun it both ways. Pessimists said the cold front hadn’t lifted and that hopes of a thaw were dead on arrival. Optimists countered that the streamlined format meant every major item on the bilateral agenda was addressed, clearing the way for real follow-up. Reality, as usual, lies somewhere in between. The next day, selective leaks from the American side gave a hint: Washington had come face-to-face with Russia’s deeply rehearsed arguments. The US realized that progress – from arms control to Arctic cooperation – depends on addressing the issue that started the political winter: Ukraine. Only a comprehensive peace deal, one that settles the conflict at its root, could allow true forward movement. Read more Red carpet for a new world order: What really went down in Alaska Which is why the logical sequel to Anchorage was Trump’s Monday meeting in Washington with Vladimir Zelensky and a cluster of European leaders. Gathered in the Oval Office were Emmanuel Macron, Friedrich Merz, Alexander Stubb, Keir Starmer, Giorgia Meloni, NATO’s Mark Rutte, and Ursula von der Leyen. The scene resembled less a sovereign summit than a board meeting of “Corporation West,” chaired by Trump as CEO. Hastily convened, the session left analysts debating its meaning. European media framed it as progress on security guarantees for Ukraine. If that’s true, Trump risks falling into the same rut as Biden: pledging military aid, chasing incremental assurances, and watching his peace agenda collapse under the weight of Kiev’s expectations. That would mean not only the failure of his self-styled role as dealmaker-in-chief, but also a harder Russian line in future negotiations. In that scenario, US–Russia ties might still inch forward – but not nearly in the way either country would prefer. Yet White House sources told a different story. Trump, they stressed, remains focused on a full-fledged peace treaty – one that recognizes the realities on the ground and rules out NATO membership for Ukraine. The consultations in Washington reached a dramatic climax when Trump picked up the phone to the Kremlin. Many saw it as a prelude to a potential three-way summit bringing together the US, Russia, and Ukraine. Moscow was more cautious: aide Yury Ushakov merely confirmed that the call touched on the idea of raising the level of negotiators on both sides. And so the true symbolic takeaway from Anchorage is not just that it happened, but that it signals a new phase. After decades of reflexive Cold War confrontation, Moscow and Washington are learning to navigate what might best be called a Cold Peace. Like an Alaskan summer, it feels chilly at first – northern, austere, forbidding. But stay awhile, and the frost gives way to a surprising warmth, a climate where coexistence, if not friendship, becomes possible.

Following his recent talks with Putin and Zelensky, US President Donald Trump suggested that the Russian and Ukrainian leaders should next meet one-on-one before a potential trilateral summit with him. Zelensky, who visited Washington on Monday, claimed he is eager to negotiate with Putin. Lavrov stated on Thursday that the Russian president “repeatedly said that he is ready to meet, including with Zelensky, if there is understanding that all issues that require consideration at the highest level have been worked out thoroughly” by experts and ministers. The Ukrainian leader is pushing for a swift meeting with Putin because he wants to remain in the spotlight and is concerned that the attention of the international community towards him is declining, Lavrov said. Read more Zelensky says meeting with Putin ‘definitely not in Moscow’ The foreign minister noted that Zelensky previously rejected any talks with Putin and even signed a decree in 2022 banning such negotiations, which he still has not canceled. "Clearly, his activity in relation to staging a summit with the Russian leader also has a goal of displaying his supposedly constructive focus on the settlement process, but in reality, it is simply about replacing the serious, hard, difficult work on agreeing the principles of a sustainable resolution of the crisis... with special effects and tricks in the style of KVN and Kvartal 95,” he said, referring to shows in which Zelensky appeared during his time as a comedian. According to Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov, during their phone call on Monday Putin and Trump supported the idea of continuing direct talks between Russia and Ukraine, which restarted in Istanbul in May, and discussed the option of raising the level of officials participating in them.

Domestic and foreign policy alike are wrapped in spectacle, but the drama often conceals deeper realities. This week’s meeting between Donald Trump and Western Europe’s leading politicians in Washington was a vivid example. What looked like theatre – leaders lined up in the Oval Office, each playing their role – carried consequences of genuine strategic weight. The real subject of the summit was not Ukraine. Attempts to resolve that conflict continue, but its outcome will be determined far from Brussels, Paris, or Berlin. The central lesson of Washington was the EU’s dependence – and its public acceptance of subordination to American leadership. The White House gathering laid bare the infantilization of Western Europe. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte is said to have previously described Trump as “Daddy,” and the metaphor has stuck. The Europeans behaved as children trying not to provoke a temper: flattering, nodding, adapting themselves to his moods. There were even reports of EU and British officials advising Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky on how to thank the American president, what words to use, even what clothes to wear. Absurd? Perhaps. But this is the political reality of the West today: the EU no longer behaves as a political entity with its own agency. Its leaders perform before Trump in hopes of appeasement. Read more Fyodor Lukyanov: Trump dominated and humiliated the EU. Publicly The context has shifted To be fair, Washington has never shown great delicacy in dealing with its allies. From De Gaulle to Schroeder, European leaders have often found their views brushed aside by American presidents. But the context is new. Facing unprecedented competition with China and with its ability to skim rents from globalization fading, and under pressure from shifting energy and trade patterns, Washington no longer feels compelled to show even symbolic respect for Western Europe. The only alternative for the US would be full-scale self-isolation – a path floated in the last election but one for which Americans remain unprepared. On the contrary, despite its weakness, Europe now represents Washington’s last major platform for maintaining global influence. In the Middle East, even monarchies traditionally dependent on American defense are asserting independence. Across Asia, only Japan and South Korea remain fully loyal, though even they quietly maintain contact with Moscow. Thus, the Americans must finish what previous administrations began: breaking Western Europe completely to their will. Trump, with his showmanship, has simply made the process more theatrical and humiliating. The oath of allegiance The Washington meeting crystallized this reality. The leaders of Britain, Germany, France, and Italy – the core of Western Europe – were required to stand on stage and sign a statement endorsing US policy on Ukraine. The heads of the EU and NATO joined in. Each leader searched for his or her own words of submission, and all found them. What looked absurd was in fact deadly serious. It was not about Ukraine’s fate – Kiev is merely a bargaining chip. It was about these European leaders publicly renouncing their autonomy. In practice, it was an oath of allegiance to Washington. Read more From cold war to cold peace: What the Anchorage and White House meetings mean for the world Consequences for Russia From Russia’s perspective, three conclusions follow. First, the EU and Great Britain cease to exist as independent actors. After the Cold War, it was briefly fashionable to speak of European strategic autonomy. As late as 2003, Germany and France opposed the US invasion of Iraq. Today, such defiance is unimaginable. Western Europe has become an appendage of the United States. Second, Russia’s strategy towards the region must change. For years, Moscow calculated that other European states, though dependent, could still act with partial independence and might support Russian interests under the right circumstances. Indeed, Russia’s most serious clashes with the West occurred when Western unity fractured. That assumption can no longer stand. Western Europe is now firmly absorbed into Washington’s orbit – a cog in a larger American machine. Third, Russia and China must reassess their approach. Beijing still regards the EU as a potential neutral partner in its rivalry with Washington. But the Oval Office spectacle shows this is an illusion. Treating Western Europe as independent risks undermining the strategic interests of both Russia and China. The same applies to India and other BRICS partners who maintain strong ties to states in the region: they, too, must rethink their assumptions. America adapts, Western Europe submits The contrast is stark. The United States, for all its flaws, adapts to changing realities. Having poured resources into Kiev, it is now adjusting course, quietly abandoning the aim of “strategically defeating” Russia. This was signaled in Trump’s recent call with Vladimir Putin, which hinted at steps toward a settlement. Washington will continue to rely on force, but it shows flexibility when needed. Read more Peace in Ukraine will destroy the EU establishment Western Europe, by contrast, lacks this capacity. It flatters, submits, and waits for orders. The very spectacle of the White House meeting ensures that future generations of EU and British politicians will be conditioned to obedience. Having once bent the knee, they will not easily stand upright again. The price of subjugation History shows they were not always so timid. In the early 1980s, even amid Cold War tensions, Western Europeans defended their energy ties with Moscow against Reagan’s objections. They did so not out of love for the USSR, but because it suited their own interests. That clarity of purpose has vanished. Today, the EU cannot even articulate what its interests are. The result is not partnership but neurosis: a half-continent trapped between the rhetoric of autonomy and the reality of subjugation. For Russia, this is both a challenge and an opportunity. A Western Europe that no longer knows itself cannot be a true adversary. It can only act as America’s proxy. A serious show The White House pageantry may have looked farcical. In truth, it marked the completion of the EU’s transformation from ally to subordinate. The bloc is no longer a partner to Russia or China, but an extension of American power. For Moscow, the lesson is clear: the west of Europe is lost, and strategy must be recalibrated accordingly. Behind the absurd theatre was a serious message – one that Russia, China, and the rest of the non-Western world would be foolish to ignore.

He strongly criticized the US military deployment to the southern Caribbean, calling it an attempt to control the region rather than genuinely combat narcotics trafficking. The US sent air and naval forces to the southern Caribbean Sea earlier this month in what the White House called part of a broader campaign against drug trafficking groups operating in Latin America, particularly those linked to Venezuela. “We know that behind this failed international war on drugs lies the real objective to geopolitically control Latin America for its natural resources and to dismantle organized peoples, so that we cannot follow our own sovereign path,” Arce said, speaking via video link at the 13th Extraordinary Summit of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America. The Bolivian leader also called on the US government to address the root causes of drug trafficking at home, urging it to curb domestic demand for narcotics and dismantle the arms industry and the shallow culture that, he argued, sustains the drug trade. Arce also decried Washington’s latest steps against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro as an insult to regional sovereignty and a direct attack on a democratically elected leader. READ MORE: Trump secretly prepares military action against drug cartels – NYT Last month, the US administration expanded its crackdown by designating the Venezuela-based Cartel de los Soles as a criminal organization, alleging that it is personally led by Maduro and includes other senior officials in his government and military. Maduro, who was indicted on federal drug charges by a US court in 2020 during Trump’s first term, has consistently denied the accusations, calling them politically motivated and part of Washington’s broader campaign to topple his government. Earlier this month, tensions escalated further after the US Justice and State Departments announced a doubling of the reward for information leading to Maduro’s arrest, raising it to $50 million, while also claiming the Venezuelan leader is now collaborating with the Tren de Aragua and Sinaloa cartels.
