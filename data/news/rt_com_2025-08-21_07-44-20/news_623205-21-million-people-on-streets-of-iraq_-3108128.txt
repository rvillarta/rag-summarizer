18 Aug, 2025 22:32 Home World News What could bring 21 million people into the streets of Iraq? They walk for days under the sun, driven by grief and resistance – turning an ancient tragedy into the world’s most powerful act of faith Arbaeen is one of the world’s most significant and massive religious events. It commemorates the tragic death of Imam Hussein – the son of Imam Ali and grandson of the Prophet Muhammad. In Iraq, Arbaeen is far more than a religious ritual. It is a powerful social, cultural, and spiritual gathering that draws millions of pilgrims from around the globe. This year, officials counted 21,103,524 arrivals. For many Shiites, the journey begins weeks before the date itself. They set out on foot from towns and cities across Iraq and from neighboring countries – primarily Iran, Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, and Lebanon. Pilgrims also come from Africa, Asia, Türkiye, Europe, and even Russia. Russians, in fact, are easy to spot: they often arrive with a giant tricolor flag. © Abbas Juma Blessing in motion An Arab proverb says: “There is blessing in movement.” In Shiite civilization, movement carries special weight. Walking forward is seen as a way of resisting decline and backsliding. That’s why the centuries-old tradition of walking the roughly 80 kilometers from Najaf to Karbala has survived – interrupted only during Saddam Hussein’s rule, when Shia Islam came under harsh political repression. As Iraqis say today: that was just a moment, and it means nothing now. “Saddam Hussein and the Baath Party waged a real war against Shiite Muslims,” recalls Sayyid Mohammad al-Yasri, head of the local branch of the Dawa Party in Najaf. We met in his spacious home, where he described life for believers under Saddam. Both he and his father had lived through years of persecution before Iraq was once again able to host millions of pilgrims each year. “The regime banned rituals, ceremonies, even prayers,” he explained. “Shiites were forbidden to travel to Karbala. That ban carried political weight, because Arbaeen has always been a symbol of the struggle for the rights of the oppressed. History remembers the ‘Arbaeen Intifada’ of 1977, when worshippers were gunned down by tanks right outside Karbala. Yet people never gave up Arbaeen. They went underground, resisted the regime, and held to their faith.” Abbas Juma and head of the local branch of the Dawa Party in Najaf Sayyid Mohammad al-Yasri © Abbas Juma “Saddam was brutal. He launched a war with Iran, poisoned Iraq’s foreign ties, and crushed his own people. We wanted to end that ourselves. But then the Americans came." “We never wanted change to come through them – it had to be the Iraqi people’s decision. We fought politically, and some of us militarily, until we finally forced the Americans out in 2011. But even then, they came back through ISIS. So Saddam is gone, but sectarian strife still plagues us. That’s the card the West plays – the US and Israel. We want unity. If our nation is united, there’s no room for Israeli aggression. Division is their goal; unity is the true path.” Scale and Organization Unlike the Hajj, in which pilgrims travel to Mecca, Arbaeen is exclusively a Shiite pilgrimage. Attendance in Karbala routinely ranges from 17 to 25 million, making it one of the largest religious gatherings on Earth. Pilgrims endure days of exhaustion, blistering heat that often tops 120°F, and all kinds of discomfort. Many believe the hardship itself is part of the test – a trial of will. Still, today’s journey is far easier than it was for their grandparents. Along the way, pilgrims are fed and given water, offered free medical care, and sheltered in tents known as mukeb. © Abbas Juma In recent years, especially since Hamas’s attack on Israel in October 2023, the Palestinian cause has become a central theme of Arbaeen. The Palestinian mukeb is more than a rest stop: it’s a museum dedicated to the Palestinian struggle and the Resistance movement. Inside are exhibits, a broadcast studio, a podcast space, a dining hall, and a clinic. For Shiites, the war in Gaza resonates deeply with the events of 680 A.D., when Hussein ibn Ali and his followers were killed in battle against the forces of Yazid ibn Muawiya. Believers see Yazid in today’s Israel and the United States, and they argue that although 1,400 years have passed, the struggle continues – an eternal battle between light and darkness, the oppressed and the oppressor, good and evil. This philosophy underpins both the Resistance movement and modern Iran’s political vision, even as the country still reels from its 12-day war with Israel. © Abbas Juma Security and sacrifice “After 2003, Iraq faced major security challenges,” says Iraqi lawyer Zaid Jabbar. “Shiite pilgrims heading to Karbala during Arbaeen were regularly attacked by suicide bombers, often from groups like al-Qaeda. They used car bombs and improvised explosives. Hundreds died each year. But after 2014, once the People’s Pilgrimage Authority was formed, the government reorganized everything and finally secured the entire route." “Even with pilgrims now arriving from Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Turkey, Russia, and Europe, security has held. Iraq spends billions providing food, water, and lodging so pilgrims can stay for free. Wealthy Iraqis donate livestock, vegetables, fruit, and sweets.” From what I saw this year, security is tighter than ever. Nobody enters Karbala without a thorough inspection. Every pocket is checked, every pill in a medicine kit examined. Just a year ago, such measures seemed impossible, and the only answer to how Iraq avoided chaos or attacks was: “by the grace of God .” © Abbas Juma Today, it’s also by the work of tens of thousands of volunteers who set aside their lives to build camps, cook meals, pour drinks, and keep order. They do it freely, out of faith, but also in hope of reward in the afterlife. You can see the joy on a volunteer’s face when you accept food from their hands — as if, in that moment, a good deed has been tallied in their favor in heaven. The tribal factor On my last day in Iraq, I visited Sheikh Amir, leader of the powerful Bani Hassan tribe, in his home. In Iraq, tribes can number in the millions, making their sheikhs wealthy and politically influential. If a tribe stretches beyond Iraq’s borders – into Saudi Arabia, for example – its leader’s influence can become regional. Q: What role do tribes play in Iraq’s political and social life? A: “The Bani Hassan and Iraq’s tribes in general are the backbone of society. They have always played an effective role in every Iraqi government. Tribes became institutions of the state – ensuring security in provinces and regions, especially when police were absent. They are closely tied to religious and political leaders. Their cohesion has been vital to Iraq’s stability. Tribes reject destructive forces, fight drugs, and support the state against terrorism. While we have our own customs, the law comes first. Anything illegal is also against tribal norms.” Sheikh Amir, leader of the powerful Bani Hassan tribe © Abbas Juma Q: What happens if a sheikh disagrees with the prime minister? A: “That has never happened. As I said, the law is supreme, and its authority extends even over the sheikhs. We live by the law.” Q: And what role do tribes play in Arbaeen? A: “A central one. The Bani Hassan tribe, in particular, has a special position because of its location on both banks of the Euphrates, near Imam Hussein’s shrine. We provide pilgrims with everything they need, day and night.” The larger picture Beyond its spiritual meaning, Arbaeen brings tangible benefits to Iraq. It strengthens Shiite identity across the region, fosters intercommunal dialogue, and, at least for a time, narrows the gap between rich and poor. Arguments are set aside, divisions blur, and people come together. In a sense, Arbaeen provides not just a religious release, but also a social one.

Following his recent talks with Putin and Zelensky, US President Donald Trump suggested that the Russian and Ukrainian leaders should next meet one-on-one before a potential trilateral summit with him. Zelensky, who visited Washington on Monday, claimed he is eager to negotiate with Putin. Lavrov stated on Thursday that the Russian president “repeatedly said that he is ready to meet, including with Zelensky, if there is understanding that all issues that require consideration at the highest level have been worked out thoroughly” by experts and ministers. The Ukrainian leader is pushing for a swift meeting with Putin because he wants to remain in the spotlight and is concerned that the attention of the international community towards him is declining, Lavrov said. Read more Zelensky says meeting with Putin ‘definitely not in Moscow’ The foreign minister noted that Zelensky previously rejected any talks with Putin and even signed a decree in 2022 banning such negotiations, which he still has not canceled. "Clearly, his activity in relation to staging a summit with the Russian leader also has a goal of displaying his supposedly constructive focus on the settlement process, but in reality, it is simply about replacing the serious, hard, difficult work on agreeing the principles of a sustainable resolution of the crisis... with special effects and tricks in the style of KVN and Kvartal 95,” he said, referring to shows in which Zelensky appeared during his time as a comedian. According to Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov, during their phone call on Monday Putin and Trump supported the idea of continuing direct talks between Russia and Ukraine, which restarted in Istanbul in May, and discussed the option of raising the level of officials participating in them.

Domestic and foreign policy alike are wrapped in spectacle, but the drama often conceals deeper realities. This week’s meeting between Donald Trump and Western Europe’s leading politicians in Washington was a vivid example. What looked like theatre – leaders lined up in the Oval Office, each playing their role – carried consequences of genuine strategic weight. The real subject of the summit was not Ukraine. Attempts to resolve that conflict continue, but its outcome will be determined far from Brussels, Paris, or Berlin. The central lesson of Washington was the EU’s dependence – and its public acceptance of subordination to American leadership. The White House gathering laid bare the infantilization of Western Europe. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte is said to have previously described Trump as “Daddy,” and the metaphor has stuck. The Europeans behaved as children trying not to provoke a temper: flattering, nodding, adapting themselves to his moods. There were even reports of EU and British officials advising Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky on how to thank the American president, what words to use, even what clothes to wear. Absurd? Perhaps. But this is the political reality of the West today: the EU no longer behaves as a political entity with its own agency. Its leaders perform before Trump in hopes of appeasement. Read more Fyodor Lukyanov: Trump dominated and humiliated the EU. Publicly The context has shifted To be fair, Washington has never shown great delicacy in dealing with its allies. From De Gaulle to Schroeder, European leaders have often found their views brushed aside by American presidents. But the context is new. Facing unprecedented competition with China and with its ability to skim rents from globalization fading, and under pressure from shifting energy and trade patterns, Washington no longer feels compelled to show even symbolic respect for Western Europe. The only alternative for the US would be full-scale self-isolation – a path floated in the last election but one for which Americans remain unprepared. On the contrary, despite its weakness, Europe now represents Washington’s last major platform for maintaining global influence. In the Middle East, even monarchies traditionally dependent on American defense are asserting independence. Across Asia, only Japan and South Korea remain fully loyal, though even they quietly maintain contact with Moscow. Thus, the Americans must finish what previous administrations began: breaking Western Europe completely to their will. Trump, with his showmanship, has simply made the process more theatrical and humiliating. The oath of allegiance The Washington meeting crystallized this reality. The leaders of Britain, Germany, France, and Italy – the core of Western Europe – were required to stand on stage and sign a statement endorsing US policy on Ukraine. The heads of the EU and NATO joined in. Each leader searched for his or her own words of submission, and all found them. What looked absurd was in fact deadly serious. It was not about Ukraine’s fate – Kiev is merely a bargaining chip. It was about these European leaders publicly renouncing their autonomy. In practice, it was an oath of allegiance to Washington. Read more From cold war to cold peace: What the Anchorage and White House meetings mean for the world Consequences for Russia From Russia’s perspective, three conclusions follow. First, the EU and Great Britain cease to exist as independent actors. After the Cold War, it was briefly fashionable to speak of European strategic autonomy. As late as 2003, Germany and France opposed the US invasion of Iraq. Today, such defiance is unimaginable. Western Europe has become an appendage of the United States. Second, Russia’s strategy towards the region must change. For years, Moscow calculated that other European states, though dependent, could still act with partial independence and might support Russian interests under the right circumstances. Indeed, Russia’s most serious clashes with the West occurred when Western unity fractured. That assumption can no longer stand. Western Europe is now firmly absorbed into Washington’s orbit – a cog in a larger American machine. Third, Russia and China must reassess their approach. Beijing still regards the EU as a potential neutral partner in its rivalry with Washington. But the Oval Office spectacle shows this is an illusion. Treating Western Europe as independent risks undermining the strategic interests of both Russia and China. The same applies to India and other BRICS partners who maintain strong ties to states in the region: they, too, must rethink their assumptions. America adapts, Western Europe submits The contrast is stark. The United States, for all its flaws, adapts to changing realities. Having poured resources into Kiev, it is now adjusting course, quietly abandoning the aim of “strategically defeating” Russia. This was signaled in Trump’s recent call with Vladimir Putin, which hinted at steps toward a settlement. Washington will continue to rely on force, but it shows flexibility when needed. Read more Peace in Ukraine will destroy the EU establishment Western Europe, by contrast, lacks this capacity. It flatters, submits, and waits for orders. The very spectacle of the White House meeting ensures that future generations of EU and British politicians will be conditioned to obedience. Having once bent the knee, they will not easily stand upright again. The price of subjugation History shows they were not always so timid. In the early 1980s, even amid Cold War tensions, Western Europeans defended their energy ties with Moscow against Reagan’s objections. They did so not out of love for the USSR, but because it suited their own interests. That clarity of purpose has vanished. Today, the EU cannot even articulate what its interests are. The result is not partnership but neurosis: a half-continent trapped between the rhetoric of autonomy and the reality of subjugation. For Russia, this is both a challenge and an opportunity. A Western Europe that no longer knows itself cannot be a true adversary. It can only act as America’s proxy. A serious show The White House pageantry may have looked farcical. In truth, it marked the completion of the EU’s transformation from ally to subordinate. The bloc is no longer a partner to Russia or China, but an extension of American power. For Moscow, the lesson is clear: the west of Europe is lost, and strategy must be recalibrated accordingly. Behind the absurd theatre was a serious message – one that Russia, China, and the rest of the non-Western world would be foolish to ignore.

He strongly criticized the US military deployment to the southern Caribbean, calling it an attempt to control the region rather than genuinely combat narcotics trafficking. The US sent air and naval forces to the southern Caribbean Sea earlier this month in what the White House called part of a broader campaign against drug trafficking groups operating in Latin America, particularly those linked to Venezuela. “We know that behind this failed international war on drugs lies the real objective to geopolitically control Latin America for its natural resources and to dismantle organized peoples, so that we cannot follow our own sovereign path,” Arce said, speaking via video link at the 13th Extraordinary Summit of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America. The Bolivian leader also called on the US government to address the root causes of drug trafficking at home, urging it to curb domestic demand for narcotics and dismantle the arms industry and the shallow culture that, he argued, sustains the drug trade. Arce also decried Washington’s latest steps against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro as an insult to regional sovereignty and a direct attack on a democratically elected leader. READ MORE: Trump secretly prepares military action against drug cartels – NYT Last month, the US administration expanded its crackdown by designating the Venezuela-based Cartel de los Soles as a criminal organization, alleging that it is personally led by Maduro and includes other senior officials in his government and military. Maduro, who was indicted on federal drug charges by a US court in 2020 during Trump’s first term, has consistently denied the accusations, calling them politically motivated and part of Washington’s broader campaign to topple his government. Earlier this month, tensions escalated further after the US Justice and State Departments announced a doubling of the reward for information leading to Maduro’s arrest, raising it to $50 million, while also claiming the Venezuelan leader is now collaborating with the Tren de Aragua and Sinaloa cartels.
