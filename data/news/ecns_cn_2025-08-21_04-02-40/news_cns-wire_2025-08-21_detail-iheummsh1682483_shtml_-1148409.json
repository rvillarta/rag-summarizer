    "article_summary": "China's major ports, including Ningbo-Zhoushan, Tangshan, and Shanghai, posted strong first-half gains due to increased exports of electric vehicles, lithium batteries, and solar cells, collectively known as the \"new trio.\" These exports, which reached 1.06 trillion yuan in 2023, have helped upgrade China's foreign trade structure and defied global headwinds. The surge in new trio exports is supported by the continuous improvement of China's port network, with new direct shipping routes to global markets.</s>"
