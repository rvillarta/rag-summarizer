Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, expressed his pleasure at visiting Afghanistan again and congratulated the country on its new achievements in national construction. Noting China has consistently been at the forefront of developing relations with Afghanistan, Wang said China will continue to support the Afghan government in maintaining stable governance, focusing on development, fighting terrorism and fostering friendly relations with neighbors in order to achieve long-term peace and stability. Stressing that both China and Afghanistan must manage the relationship between security and development effectively, Wang said strengthening China-Afghanistan security cooperation will ensure the security of economic cooperation, while deepening economic ties will enhance Afghanistan's security capabilities. Wang emphasized the hope that Afghanistan would continue to combat the East Turkestan Islamic Movement terrorist forces, removing obstacles and injecting momentum into the deeper development of China-Afghanistan relations. Noting this year marks the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Afghanistan, Wang said China supports Afghanistan's "economy-centered" policy and is willing to work together with Afghanistan to strengthen cooperation in areas such as trade, agriculture, poverty reduction, water conservancy, connectivity and cultural exchanges, thus bringing greater benefits to both nations and their people while contributing to regional peace, stability and development. Afghanistan's Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi welcomed Wang's visit and thanked China for its valuable support in opposing external interference in Afghanistan and its significant contributions to maintaining regional peace and development. Stressing friendship with China is the cornerstone of Afghanistan's foreign policy, Muttaqi said that thanks to China's assistance, Afghanistan has been able to smoothly govern the country. In light of significant changes in the international and regional situation, it is the right time for China and Afghanistan to deepen cooperation, Muttaqi said. Afghanistan is willing to enhance bilateral relations on the basis of equality and mutual respect, strengthen exchanges at all levels, establish a regular economic and trade dialogue mechanism and promote practical cooperation to achieve more mutual benefits, he said. Afghanistan attaches great importance to China's security concerns and will never allow any person or force to use Afghan territory to harm China, Muttaqi said, adding that Afghanistan is willing to strengthen counterterrorism cooperation with China to jointly maintain regional peace and stability.
