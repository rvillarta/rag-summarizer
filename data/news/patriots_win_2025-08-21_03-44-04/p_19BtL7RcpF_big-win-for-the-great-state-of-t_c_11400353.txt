Florida and Texas got half-invaded without doing much of anything about it ‚Äî other than sucking off the Latinos that invaded them and calling you RACIST if you opposed the invasion. Redistricting is nice, but Texas and Florida are not ‚Äúsaving the country.‚Äù We need MUCH stronger leaders than Greg Abbott and Ron DeFaggot if the USA is going to have any hope of being great again. permalink possibletower 2 points 2 hours ago Cope, stormfag.
