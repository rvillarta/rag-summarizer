Unlike the bleach barbie... She is quiet but deadly which is what you need to be when you're dealing with the swamp. permalink 1MonkeyJr 8 points 12 hours ago Tulsi continues to impress and excel. permalink Mortal_Wombat -1 points 10 hours ago I heard her saying some shit on the tv earlier in passing professing the lie that 9/11 was comitted by camel jockeys armed with box cutters. What a load of horse shit. permalink Agent_86 1 points 8 hours ago Found one. permalink Mortal_Wombat 1 points 1 hour ago You must have looked in the mirror. permalink NYforTrump 2 points 8 hours ago Yeah I'm really liking her. Noem is also doing surprisingly well in DHS. She's pretty competent at matters not related to shooting puppies. permalink edxzxz 9 points 12 hours ago The vetting process could be so easy to weed out the TDS traitors - have them come in one at a time, tell them to say 'China' like Trump says it. If they do it reasonably well and can't resist smiling, they're good. Otherwise, c'ya! permalink StoneRealist 4 points 11 hours ago I remember when people were on here bitching about her appointment. Faggots. permalink Mr_Rightside OP 3 points 12 hours ago https://x.com/nicksortor/status/1958244951864570198 permalink Scottx 2 points 8 hours ago The lady turned out to be tough as nails. She is staying the course despite the shit she said and did in the past. permalink MAGALADON9 2 points 11 hours ago This is good but when I hear numbers I'm reminded we just "lost" a trillion dollars to scams over covid. A fucking Trillion - a thousand Billions. That would run that bloat for well.over 1,000 years. permalink Jnicolet4431 2 points 6 hours ago MVP of the administration so far . Trump's biggest suprise although Marco Rubio is destroying communist at MVP levels . permalink JimmyJ 1 points 4 hours ago Ay sauce with this? permalink PoleWatcher 1 points 4 hours ago When will we see some money? permalink wmmiv2016v2 1 points 11 hours ago Show me.
