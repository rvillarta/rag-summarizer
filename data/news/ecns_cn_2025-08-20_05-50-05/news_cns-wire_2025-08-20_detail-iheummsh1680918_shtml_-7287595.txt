According to customs statistics, China's trade with SCO partners totaled 2.11 trillion yuan (about $293 billion) from January to July, up 3% year on year. Exports of industrial robots and agricultural machinery surged 27.1% and 47.8%, respectively, while imports of electronic components and agricultural products rose 12.1% and 6.%. In recent years, China-SCO economic and trade cooperation has expanded steadily, with trade volumes repeatedly hitting new highs. When the SCO was founded in 2001, China's trade with other members stood at just 100 billion yuan. By 2024, the figure had soared to 3.65 trillion yuan, more than 30 times higher.
