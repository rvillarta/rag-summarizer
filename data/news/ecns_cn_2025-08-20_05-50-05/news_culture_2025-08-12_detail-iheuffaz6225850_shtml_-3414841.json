    "article_summary": "Parisians and visitors can legally swim in the Seine for the first time since 1923, marking a significant environmental progress and public reconnection with the historic river. The revival is seen as a legacy of the 2024 Olympic Games, with three official swimming zones now open. After a temporary closure due to sewage overflow, swimming resumed on July 10. The reopening is a milestone in a century-long effort to clean up the Seine.</s>"
