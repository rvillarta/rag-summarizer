The new base aims to enhance China-Africa cooperation through academic research, teaching programs, dialogue, case sharing, and field visits. Its inauguration ceremony coincided with a symposium attended by Zhao Yuezhi, director of the Research and Teaching Base for Global South Communication at Tsinghua University. "The School of Journalism and Communication at Tsinghua University is committed to combining academic excellence with social responsibility," Zhao said. "This collaboration with Rendeavour offers students and scholars direct engagement with African contexts, enabling real-world learning and cross-cultural understanding." Over the past three years, Tatu City has welcomed more than 1,000 Chinese academics, companies, and business leaders for visits covering topics ranging from investment opportunities to healthcare research in local communities. Currently, the city is home to seven Chinese enterprises representing $400 million in investment and creating over 10,000 jobs in industries including textiles, healthcare, renewable energy, construction, automotive and real estate. "Rendeavour is honored to partner with the School of Journalism and Communication at Tsinghua University to create opportunities for cross-cultural academic exchange, providing live case studies and seamless access to Africa for Chinese entrepreneurs and scholars," Stephen Jennings, founder and CEO of Rendeavour said. Beyond Kenya, Rendeavour's developments in Nigeria, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo will also be part of the partnership, expanding the scope of China-Africa engagement.
