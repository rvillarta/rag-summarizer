The suit thus became the first of its kind on China's space station to meet the goal of supporting 20 EVAs within 4 years. China's space station spacesuit B has been worn by 11 astronauts across eight manned space missions, according to Zhang Wanxin from the China Astronaut Research and Training Center. An extravehicular spacesuit is essential equipment for astronauts during EVAs in space, ensuring their safety and enabling efficient operations outside the cabin. The second-generation Feitian extravehicular spacesuit on China's space station has a three-year service life in orbit. During this period, it can be used for at least 15 EVAs, according to its design standards. China's space station extravehicular spacesuit is the first flight product in China to perform in-orbit lifespan assessment and extended use. On July 15, Tianzhou-9 cargo craft delivered a new batch of supplies to China's space station, including two sets of second-generation Feitian extravehicular spacesuits, labeled D and E. Extravehicular spacesuits D and E have been unpacked and inspected and are in good condition. They will be gradually used in future EVAs, Zhang said. Compared to the country's first-generation Feitian spacesuits for spacewalks, the second-generation suits feature key technological advances. They have a longer lifespan, are safer and more reliable, and support astronauts' operations more efficiently, providing strong support for EVAs during the construction and operation of China's space station, according to Zhang.
