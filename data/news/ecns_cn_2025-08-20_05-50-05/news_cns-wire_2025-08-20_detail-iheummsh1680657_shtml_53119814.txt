Mao made the remarks to answer the question about China-U.S. technology competition at a press conference. She noted that over the past few months, China has hosted the World Artificial Intelligence Conference, the World Robot Conference, and the World Humanoid Robot Games. "The events not only showcased the innovations in AI and robotics, but also provided the world with new platforms for exchanges over frontier technologies and conversations on future industries," she said. China believes that only through openness and cooperation can innovation thrive and spur human progress, the spokesperson added.
