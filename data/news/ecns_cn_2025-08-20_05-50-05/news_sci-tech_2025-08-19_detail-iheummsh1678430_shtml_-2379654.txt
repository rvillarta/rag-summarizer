Following a smooth landing, the aircraft was confirmed to be in sound condition, with its control system normal and all systems in stable operation. It then departed for Yichang in central China's Hubei Province for painting. The successful test flight indicates that the aircraft meets design requirements, complies with operational safety standards and is ready for delivery. The AG600 is China's independently developed civil special-purpose aircraft, designed to address the urgent needs of the national emergency rescue system and the natural disaster prevention and control system, helping safeguard lives and property. With a maximum practical range of 4,500 kilometers, the AG600 is a powerful tool for forest firefighting. Equipped with a "water-scooping bucket" on its belly, the aircraft can scoop up to 12 tonnes of water in just 20 seconds by simply skimming across the water surface before heading for firefighting operations. The aircraft obtained its type certificate from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) on April 20, 2025. In May, the first batch-produced AG600-1101 rolled off the production line and completed its production test flight. In June, the aircraft officially entered batch production after receiving CAAC certification. On July 31, the second batch-produced AG600-1102 completed its final assembly and rolled off the assembly line, subsequently undergoing flight tests before its maiden flight.
