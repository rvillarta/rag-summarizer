    "article_summary": "The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has released updated recommendations for vaccines, including Covid-19 shots for infants and young children, differing from current CDC recommendations. The AAP recommends Covid-19 vaccines for all children ages 6 through 23 months, and a single dose for high-risk children aged 2 to 18, while the CDC's recommendations are based on shared clinical decision-making. Tension between AAP and federal health policy has been escalating, particularly over changes to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).</s>"
