    "article_summary": "President Donald Trump claims to have ended six wars during his second term, spanning various regions, and is seeking a Nobel Peace Prize. However, the validity of these claims is questionable, with some agreements being more akin to ceasefires than permanent peace deals. Trump's record is also marred by failed peace efforts with North Korea and Israel-Hamas conflict.</s>"
