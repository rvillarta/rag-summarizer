    "article_summary": "Federal Judge Rodolfo Ruiz issues a split decision on the legal rights of detainees at the \"Alligator Alcatraz\" immigration detention center in Florida's Everglades. The judge dismisses part of the suit and moves the case to a different jurisdiction, as the Trump administration designated the Krome North Processing Center as a site for their cases to be heard, making claims of lack of confidential access to lawyers and hearings in immigration court moot.</s>"
