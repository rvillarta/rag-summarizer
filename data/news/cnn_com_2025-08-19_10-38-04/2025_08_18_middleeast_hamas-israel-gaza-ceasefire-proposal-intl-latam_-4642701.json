    "article_summary": "Hamas has agreed to a new ceasefire proposal mediated by Qatar and Egypt, aiming to renew talks and prevent a major Israeli assault on Gaza City. The proposal includes the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners in exchange for a ceasefire, but Israel's position remains unchanged, calling for the release of all hostages, disarmament of Hamas, and Israeli security control of Gaza. The new proposal preserves 98% of a previous US proposal, with Egypt and Qatar inviting US envoy Steve Witkoff to Cairo for further discussions.</s>"
