    "article_summary": "President Donald Trump falsely claimed that the U.S. is the only country using mail-in voting and that Democrats cheat at unprecedented levels through it. These assertions are debunked as numerous countries use mail-in voting, and there is no evidence of widespread fraud in U.S. elections. The Constitution also does not grant the president the power to dictate state election policies.</s>"
