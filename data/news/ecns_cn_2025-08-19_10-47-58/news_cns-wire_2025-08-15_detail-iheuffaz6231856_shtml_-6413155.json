    "article_summary": "Chinese scientist creates ultra-resilient soft robot that can survive 108-meter falls. The 2-centimeter, 2-gram robot, inspired by insects' muscle contraction mechanisms, can autonomously crawl, jump, and swim in complex environments. It's energy-efficient and ideal for rescue in rubble and narrow spaces, as well as underwater environmental inspections.</s>"
