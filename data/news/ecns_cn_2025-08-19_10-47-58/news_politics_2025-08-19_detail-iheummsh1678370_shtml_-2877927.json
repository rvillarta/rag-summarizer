    "article_summary": "Chinese Foreign Ministry refutes Taiwan's claims over the 'San Francisco treaty', asserting that it does not change China's sovereignty over Taiwan, which was confirmed by the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Japanese Instrument of Surrender. The ministry also considers the treaty as \"illegal and invalid\" due to its exclusion of the PRC and the Soviet Union in its drafting.</s>"
