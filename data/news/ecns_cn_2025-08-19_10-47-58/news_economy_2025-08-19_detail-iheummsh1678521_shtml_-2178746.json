    "original_title": "Monetary easing to persist in near term",
    "article_summary": "China's monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative in the near term, supporting credit expansion and steady capital market expectations. This is aimed at preventing idle capital circulation and encouraging funds to flow into the real economy, rather than tightening credit or reducing leverage. Any further cuts in the reserve requirement ratio or interest rates may occur later this year, depending on economic data and potential U.S. Fed rate cuts.</s>"
