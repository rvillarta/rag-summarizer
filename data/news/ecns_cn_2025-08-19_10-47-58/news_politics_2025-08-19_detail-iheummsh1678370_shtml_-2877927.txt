Speaking at Monday's press conference, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning emphasized that Taiwan's return to China was a crucial part of the victory in World War II and the post-war international order. She noted that a series of legally binding documents, including the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Japanese Instrument of Surrender, confirmed China's sovereignty over Taiwan. "The historical and legal fact that Taiwan belongs to China is undisputed," Mao said. On October 1, 1949, the PRC was established. Mao stated that since then, the PRC has become the sole legitimate government representing all of China. She pointed out that this was a change in government, but China's status as a subject under international law has remained the same, and its sovereignty and territory have therefore remained unchanged. Mao stressed that the PRC government fully exercises China's sovereignty, including over Taiwan. She also mentioned that the so-called San Francisco treaty is "illegal and invalid," noting that it was unilaterally drafted by the United States and several other countries while intentionally excluding the PRC and the Soviet Union. Mao added that the treaty violated the 1942 Declaration by United Nations, signed by 26 nations including China, the U.S., and the UK, as well as the UN Charter and fundamental principles of international law. "Any attempt to address Taiwan's status or dispose of China's territory and sovereign rights without China's participation is illegal and void," Mao said. Mao further criticized Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities, accusing them of betraying the national interest and distorting World War II history. "No matter what the DPP authorities say or do, they cannot change the historical and legal fact that Taiwan is part of China, nor can they undermine the international consensus on the one-China principle. They cannot stop the historical trend that China will and must be reunified," Mao stressed.
