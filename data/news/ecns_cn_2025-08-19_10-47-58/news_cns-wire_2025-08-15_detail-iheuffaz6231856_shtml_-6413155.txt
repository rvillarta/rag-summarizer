(Photo courtesy of Westlake University) (ECNS) -- Jiang Hanqing, a professor at Westlake University, has created an insect-sized soft robot that can withstand a 108-meter drop and spring back to life after impact. This tiny creature is only 2 centimeters long, weighs just 2 grams, and looks very much like the resilient yet dreaded cockroach, Jiang told China News Network, adding that the robot can autonomously crawl, jump, and swim in complex environments. Jiang explained that in nature, small creatures like insects move swiftly and nimbly thanks to their highly efficient muscle contraction mechanisms, which allow their tiny bodies to unleash tremendous force. Inspired by this, Jiang‘s team designed a motion system that mimics muscle contractions using a balance of elastic force and static magnetic attraction. The drive system consists of a coil embedded with a soft magnet at the bottom and a hard magnet on top, enclosed in a silicone shell that provides elasticity. When powered, the coil generates a magnetic field that enhances attraction between the magnets. This clever combination of magnetic attraction and elasticity enables the robot to deliver an impressive output force of up to 210 N/kg and a deformation rate of 60% under a low voltage of less than 4V. The robot is extremely energy-efficient, consuming only 56 milliwatts, about the same as a small LED light. In application, for example, the crawling robot can survive extreme impacts, falling freely from heights of 30 meters or even 108 meters without damage, making it ideal for rescue in rubble and narrow spaces. For another, the swimming robot can swim autonomously for over an hour in natural water bodies, potentially playing a role in underwater environmental inspections or pollution monitoring in the future.
