Speaking at the opening ceremony of a special photo exhibition at the National Museum of Kenya, in Nairobi, Simba Arati, Kenya's governor for Kisii county, highlighted the historical significance of China's 14-year resistance against Japanese aggression. "This was not merely a local conflict," he said. "It was a monumental part of the global struggle known as the World Anti-Fascist War, a struggle that saved human civilization and defended world peace." Arati noted that China, as the main Eastern theatre of World War II, suffered more than 35 million military and civilian casualties and played a decisive role in defeating Japanese fascism. He urged the international community to resist distortions of history that minimize China's contribution or recast Japan as a victim. Chinese Ambassador to Kenya Guo Haiyan said the victory of the Chinese People's war of resistance marked the country's first complete triumph against foreign aggression in modern history, restoring its status as a major world power and paving the way for national rejuvenation. "The Nuremberg and Tokyo war crimes tribunals consigned the perpetrators to the condemnation of history," she said, warning against attempts to distort the truth of World War II or undermine its outcomes. Guo emphasized the central role of the United Nations in maintaining global peace and criticized unilateralism and interference in bilateral relations. She reaffirmed the China's sovereignty over Taiwan and expressed gratitude for Kenya's steadfast support of the one-China principle. Anne Wang'ombe, principal secretary of Kenya's State Department for Gender Affairs and Affirmative Action, linked the commemoration to contemporary challenges, noting that war disproportionately impacts women, children, older persons and persons with disabilities. She proposed joint initiatives with the Chinese Embassy to support women's economic empowerment through skills training, access to credit and market linkages. "This history underscores a fundamental truth: when nations unite against a common threat, they can forge a more just and secure world for all," Wang'ombe said. "Our presence here today is proof that the sacrifices of the past were not in vain." The exhibition aims to honor the sacrifices made during the Chinese People's war of resistance against Japanese aggression, preserve historical records and promote a shared commitment to peace and cooperation.
