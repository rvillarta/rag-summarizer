    "article_summary": "Chinese doctors at Shanghai Changzheng Hospital successfully treated a critically injured patient with a rare and severe cervical spine injury, known as head-neck dissociation, in a life-saving breakthrough. This was the first time the hospital's director, Chen Huajiang, had seen such an injury in his 30-year career. The patient, who suffered the injury from a robotic arm accident, was close to death due to quadriplegia, cardiac arrest, and severe spinal cord damage. A multidisciplinary team developed a precise surgical plan, and during a three-hour operation, they removed a massive hematoma, corrected the vertebral dislocation, and stabilized the spine using a combination of conventional and auxiliary plating. The patient has regained consciousness and begun rehabilitation.</s>"
