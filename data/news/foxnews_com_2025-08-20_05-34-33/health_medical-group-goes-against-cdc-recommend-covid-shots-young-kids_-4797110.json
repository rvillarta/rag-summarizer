    "article_summary": "The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has recommended COVID-19 vaccines for children aged 6 months to 23 months and high-risk children over 2, going against the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which no longer recommends the vaccine for children. The AAP's vaccine schedule includes immunizations against 18 diseases for children from birth to age 18, and the CDC now advocates for shared clinical decision-making between parents and doctors regarding COVID-19 vaccination.</s>"
