    "article_summary": "California Democrats face a lawsuit from Republican state lawmakers over a plan to redraw congressional districts, aiming to add up to five left-leaning seats. The GOP argues that the move violates the state's Constitution and undermines voter-approved redistricting power. Meanwhile, in Texas, Republicans are pushing for a new congressional map to create up to five Republican-leaning districts, amid a similar controversy over redistricting ahead of the midterm elections.</s>"
