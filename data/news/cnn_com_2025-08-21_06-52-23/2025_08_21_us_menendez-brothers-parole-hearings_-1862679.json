    "article_summary": "Menendez Brothers Seek Parole After 30 Years for 1989 Parent Murders: The brothers, Erik and Lyle Menendez, are set to face California parole hearings this week, potentially granting them freedom after spending over three decades in prison for the 1989 killings of their parents. Their release could still depend on Governor Gavin Newsom's decision, despite opposition from the current district attorney. The hearings will determine if the brothers pose an unreasonable risk to society, considering their criminal history, personal change, and behavior in prison. The brothers have maintained the killings were in self-defense due to years of physical and sexual abuse by their father.</s>"
