    "article_summary": "California and Texas lawmakers are set to pass their respective redistricting efforts on Thursday, with California Democrats aiming to temporarily replace their congressional maps through 2030 via a constitutional amendment. The move is in response to the Texas plan and President Trump's efforts to create a more favorable 2026 midterm election map. The California legislature will consider the proposed referendum, with a two-thirds majority vote needed in both chambers to pass. In Texas, the Republican-dominated state Senate is expected to approve the redistricting plan on Thursday, sending it to Governor Greg Abbott for signing into law.</s>"
