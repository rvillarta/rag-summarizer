381 The 19 states that give driver's licenses to illegals should be sued posted 11 hours ago by FearGodTheAlmighty 11 comments MAGA 11 comments Datamancer 12 points 11 hours ago Any truck with a license plate issued in one of the 19 states should be subject to being pulled over for no reason and the driver subject to a English proficiency test. If they fail, the truck and cargo is confiscated, the driver subject to citizenship validation, and if not a citizen, deported on the spot. If a citizen provided a one-way bus ticket to the capitol city of the state issuing the license. permalink Jujubees 7 points 10 hours ago I’m in one of those states, it’s also how you get registered to vote automatically. This wasn’t an accident it was done on purpose. You know it’s bad when you have jury duty that is pulled from registered voters and 10-20% are excused because they aren’t citizens. permalink FearGodTheAlmighty OP 1 points 6 hours ago Jesus Christ permalink FearGodTheAlmighty OP 6 points 11 hours ago California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington. DC also does this, but hopefully that gets taken care of with the new federalization. permalink KarenLukasik 3 points 10 hours ago count KY in,if you bribe them… permalink HoganP 5 points 7 hours ago Pull all federal funding from these states until it stops. permalink FearGodTheAlmighty OP 2 points 6 hours ago Amen permalink Moebius 5 points 10 hours ago I think they should apply the same principles of 'Reciprocity' they apply to CCAs to State Issued Driver Licenses. Driving is a Privilege, Not a Right like the 2A's Protected RKBA. California does not Honor ANY other State's CCA's even though their's is honored in 28 states. That shit needs to change right quick... permalink Zskills 3 points 10 hours ago However bad you think this problem is, it's worse. These semi truck jeets are often completely illiterate let alone speaking english, and can't do anything without calling dispatch or using a translate app. permalink InterloperKO 1 points 10 hours ago Hung permalink learntocode 1 points 19 minutes ago Sued?!
