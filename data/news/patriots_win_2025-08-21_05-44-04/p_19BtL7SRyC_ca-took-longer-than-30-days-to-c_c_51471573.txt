CA leftist officials keep shuffling the votes around until they get a result they like. It is a rats' nest of thieving demons who all must be changed out---or, and this is the case--eliminated altogether once we have in place quantum voting from personal phones/computers. It's coming soon. ~ 21 Aug 2025 permalink permissible_missile 13 points 2 hours ago quantum voting Apex cringe permalink Meister_Bockmist 4 points 1 hour ago Listen, Jack, I order my quantum pizza from my quantum phone, and i get my Schr√∂dinger's with extra cheese and a cat in the box. permalink Side_o_beef_curtains 5 points 2 hours ago Can confirm.

We may never know what percentage of our Congress became Benjamin Netanyahu's puppets. 'Tells you everything you need to know about who our Deep State is. permalink NotYourMan 2 points 17 minutes ago Once democrats conquered the state of California, they changed the voting laws to favor cheating. This is the last step and that step involves no voter ID, ballot box stuffing, ballot harvesting. Its always the same with democrats after they conquer a city or state. permalink DCPower 1 points 16 minutes ago Please support Mike Lindell of MyPillow to fight for election integrity!

Disabled, military, overseas? Too bad. permalink FuckU/Spez 6 points 2 hours ago Almost every country has a consulate or embassy. Go vote there in person. That's what other countries do. I don't trust the disabled vote.

I need to be able to mail it! we've seen that US postal workers now go through ballots and dump the ones from opponents. when you put it in ANY mail, even US mail, you're destroying chain of custody. permalink glow-operator-2-0 2 points 20 minutes ago Union soldiers were trained / shipped to their registered counties to vote in 1864.

That's what democracy is. Now he can run around and say, "Hey, the people voted for this, Im just doing what the people want" ;) . . . permalink glow-operator-2-0 1 points 19 minutes ago People voted for Prop 13 in 1978 and against a later Prop 5 (2020s) that would undo Prop 13.
