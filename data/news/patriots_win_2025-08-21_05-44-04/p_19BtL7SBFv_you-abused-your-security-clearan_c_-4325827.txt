193 You abused your security clearance by bad mouthing the President while having your clearance. You have been badmouthing him for years. Now you don’t have a clearance. You signed the 2019 letter. Everything I said is accurate. Enjoy losing your Kentucky Senate race too, loser. posted 4 hours ago by PiratePatriotParrot PRO 11 comments Laura Loomer @LauraLoomer • 11h You abused your security clearance by bad mouthing the President while having your clearance.

Joel Willett @realJoelWillett • 11h Fact Check: I didn't have a security clearance in 2019. You can't "abuse" something you don't have. One hell of a scoop, Laura. 11 comments Belleoffreedom 3 points 3 hours ago So, who's lying here? It's hard to tell. permalink SanityGumby 7 points 57 minutes ago He is. He had a security clearance. And it was revoked yesterday. So he is lying. permalink Tookens 2 points 3 hours ago "That depends on what the meaning of 'is' is." permalink PatPede1 1 points 3 hours ago Both? That seems to be the most likely answer in political circles. permalink SqRt7744 -2 points 1 hour ago Probably both to a greater or lesser degree. I don't know or care about Willett, but I know Loomer is a liar. permalink BarrysOFace -2 points 1 hour ago Pretty sure having a clearance doesn't prevent you from badmouthing the president. permalink SanityGumby 2 points 56 minutes ago No retard, leaking secret materials you have access to in order to lie and leak does. Which he did. permalink BarrysOFace 1 points 39 minutes ago I'm reading a tweet. Big Larry accused him of "bad mouthing" the president. With solipsism like that I bet you are a cat lady. permalink SqRt7744 -5 points 1 hour ago Loomer is a worthless israel firster. Her latest big success was sucessfully getting her controlled puppet Rubio to deny special medical treatment visas for Palestinian kids with serious injuries / medical conditions that can't be treated in razed gaza. Yay!? Gtfooh you psycho bitch. permalink SanityGumby 4 points 60 minutes ago Go back to India faggot permalink Ligersrule1 0 points 33 minutes ago Fuck ALL semites! permalink 193 You abused your security clearance by bad mouthing the President while having your clearance.
