Idiots here need to stop being high on hopium and come back to reality and understand all this is just theater. It's a never ending movie with no valuable end result. permalink Metriz77 1 points 8 hours ago So is arresting people on dumb charges. Just because Dems do it, doesn‚Äôt mean we need to. Bigger fish to fry. And if you think lower taxes, huge incoming tariff revenue, the most secure border ever and illegal alien sex deviants being arrested are just theatrics then you got your head up your ass and really don‚Äôt care about this country. permalink imbackbish 0 points 13 hours ago COOL.

Supposed to be the other way around. permalink TheTruthAlwaysWins 2 points 13 hours ago I don't think we will see major names indicted/arrested until midterms are over. And when you think it through based on scope and size, what Trump is doing is logical. Who still has power to keep stallling the MAGA agenda? All dems are globalists, or just sellouts for money. Same with the repubs/neo-cons/rhinos. This is an ongoing conspiracy, and Pam is using "Grand Conspiracy" to go after them. Of the 535 on the hill, you'd be hard pressed to find 35 that are not criminals. They have to be eliminated. We still have some hard battles ahead of us. From ChatGPT: A conspiracy is simply when two or more people secretly plan to do something illegal or harmful. It doesn‚Äôt need to be big‚Äîit could be a small group planning a scam, a cover-up, or even just lying together for personal gain. The key idea is secrecy and coordination. A Grand Conspiracy is usually used to describe a much larger, often global or society-wide plot. Instead of a handful of people, it involves the belief that powerful groups‚Äîgovernments, corporations, secret societies‚Äîare all working together behind the scenes. It‚Äôs less about one crime and more about an ongoing, all-encompassing hidden agenda. permalink HKgoneWild 0 points 10 hours ago They're 2 more weeks-ing us.

It's over 50 names. Heads of agencies, politicians, Democrat operators,. And EVERY ONE OF THESE CRIMINALS has left a faint paper trail, a faint digital trail...a faint financial trail. And this web has MANY Queens of the Demonweb pits. I for one am patient. Patient as the Count of Monte Cristo. And when we get our Justice, it will burn the nest of evil to its core.
