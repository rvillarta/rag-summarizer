156 Raise your kids right. 🔥🗑️ ️ GARBAGE PEOPLE 🗑️🔥 posted 3 hours ago by blue5707 7 comments suzy @Suzy_1776 • 12h We have a seven year old entrepreneur in our neighborhood. He put out flyers and everything. He rolls your garbage can to the curb the night before trash pick up & rolls it back to your garage once it’s picked up. We of course signed up for this service & we pay him $5 a week. 7 comments Choomguy 5 points 2 hours ago Good forthe kid, but that seems a little steep permalink NoFalseSong 7 points 1 hour ago The eternal boomer permalink The_Return_of_User_x 2 points 27 minutes ago He doesn't have insurance either! Gasp!! permalink UncleSlayton 1 points 28 minutes ago $5 today = $1 in 2000 permalink R3Dpill 4 points 47 minutes ago I just made the same deal $5 with my neighbors kid. They are thrilled to earn money. permalink MarshallB 3 points 1 hour ago How many days a week do you get a pickup? I get it one day a week now after twice a week for decades (and before wheels on garbage cans or luggage) permalink DJTJ2024 1 points 54 minutes ago Ugh, just another subscription service to deal with! What happens if I forget to cancel? Will he still take out my garbage when he's 35? permalink 156 Raise your kids right. 🔥🗑️ ️ GARBAGE PEOPLE 🗑️🔥 posted 3 hours ago by blue5707 7 comments suzy @Suzy_1776 • 12h We have a seven year old entrepreneur in our neighborhood.
