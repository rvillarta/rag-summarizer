    "article_summary": "Texas Legislature aims to eliminate property taxes, sparking debate over property rights, taxation, and school funding. Critics argue that high property taxes are a form of government theft and hinder home ownership. Some propose charging the federal government taxes for holding land within states, while others suggest using the funds for property tax rebates. Critics also question the necessity of property taxes, particularly in light of advancements in technology and remote learning, and the bloated administration costs in school districts.</s>"
