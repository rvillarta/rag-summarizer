This is why the pendulum is swinging back to the right. No one with a stake in a strong, functioning society wants this. permalink Gigigurrlll 5 points 3 hours ago 100% agree! Exactly the right words to describe what is happening today. My word choice, "The patients are running the asylum." permalink sleepinggiant 3 points 1 hour ago If you go back to why homosexuality is a mental illness that shit made way more sense than this shit trying to claim its not. permalink CasuallyObservant 4 points 3 hours ago Insanity.

Disgusting. Better question is why is the Smithsonian even entertaining this garbage? Time to fired the woke retards running it! permalink lifeisahologram 3 points 1 hour ago Museum Guide: “Here we have a section honoring David Homo” 😊 Guest: “What did he do” 🤨 Museum Guide: “He was the first black gay transsexual radio operator” 😃 Guest: “so you’re honoring him because he is the first radio operator to stick his penis inside an asshole?” Museum Guide: “No!” 😡 Guest: “Well he wasn’t the first ever radio operator, so what are you honoring him for?” 🤔 Museum: “well, we’re honoring him….for…being the first…. radio operator to stick his penis inside an asshole…” 😬 permalink CloudNine 2 points 37 minutes ago I had to look it up- Friend of Dorothy is a term for a gay man, derived from the character Dorothy Gale of the Oz series or the actress Judy Garland. The term was used to avoid hostility and express solidarity in the 20th century, and has connections to queer subtext, rainbow flag, and Judy Garland's life. permalink eclectic22 2 points 3 hours ago They are mocking us. permalink eclectic22 2 points 3 hours ago Invert? Pervert! permalink tt777 1 points 2 hours ago Disgusting. permalink indigo_truther 1 points 4 minutes ago So glad I don't know most of these permalink Captain92 1 points 49 seconds ago You solved world hunger, create technological marvels, and saved millions of lives. That's what people care about. Not how much cock you take up the butt from your boyfriend named Larry. In fact, we could really care less. permalink goat_nebula 1 points 12 seconds ago Gender-Bender and Friend of Dorothy. I feel like some of these weirdos are the punch line to a bad prank and just have no clue. permalink ConductProbation 1 points 37 minutes ago So... now the most important US history and meaning is defined as perverts and slavery. Got it. permalink Antenna 1 points 54 minutes ago WTF is "mahu"? permalink DJTJ2024 1 points 53 minutes ago Dafuq is a mahu? permalink Trumptrooper23 1 points 27 minutes ago Urning??? permalink 142 Bizarre things happening at Smithsonian. posted 3 hours ago by kinbergfan 17 comments Rapid Response 47 @RapidResponse47 • 17h The Smithsonian's "LGBTQ+ History" includes "lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, transgender, queer, transsexual, transvestite, mahu, homosexual, fluid, invert, urning, third sex, two sex, gender-bender, sapphist, hijra, friend of Dorothy, drag queen/king, and many other experiences." 🤨
