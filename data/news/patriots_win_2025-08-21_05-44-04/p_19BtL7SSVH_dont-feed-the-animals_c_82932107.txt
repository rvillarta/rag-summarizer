You can’t help the sea turtle get to the sea you can’t dig it out of the ground. You can’t shine lights and different things and you’ve gotta leave it completely alone because the survival of its species demand that you not help it……. OK, I buy into that. So what the hell is our government? permalink 82 Don't Feed The Animals posted 2 hours ago by rdvs34283 1 comments
