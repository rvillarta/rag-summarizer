Or is she still allowed to be a judge after proving that she has no idea what the fuck sheâ€™s doing? permalink Archdukeofevil 5 points 10 hours ago I want more.

Wtf? permalink mygovisacommie 1 points 7 hours ago our tax dollars pay her salary, and therefor we all paid for that ridiculous ass weave. fucking clown world keeps on spinning permalink Burneraccountno4 1 points 7 hours ago Not a win until they're out of the country.
