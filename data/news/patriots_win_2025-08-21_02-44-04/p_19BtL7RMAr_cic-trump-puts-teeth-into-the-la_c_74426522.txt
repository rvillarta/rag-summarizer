People who hire illegals are traitors on a local level. We used to shun people who would do shit like that permalink FrmrAmericanRepublic 15 points 5 hours ago They should take that fucking dead-eyed turban turd and strap him to the front of a truck and slam it into a fucking concrete wall. Then the biz that hired this fucker should be stripped of any ability to ever have one again, and the CEO and officers imprisoned. I mean all the way banned. permalink MayorMcSixaplix 4 points 5 hours ago Even better: slam him into the newly painted black border wall. permalink Standingoak 11 points 6 hours ago Dose "shun" = tar & feather ? permalink Wtf_socialismreally 6 points 5 hours ago No, it means you don't bake them cake. permalink thevagabond 3 points 4 hours ago No, we're not Murderers and Vigilantes. This isn't batman. but we can shun those businesses. The businesses can be prosecuted. reach out. do the needful. permalink Standingoak 1 points 3 hours ago Just melt the tar next time . Don't boil it like when we throw it over the parapets🙄 permalink thevagabond 5 points 4 hours ago AND WE WILL AGAIN BROTHER. JUST FIND THEM OUT. SHAME THEM. AND DESTROY THEM FOR THEIR DECISIONS permalink Hanging_Chad 22 points 6 hours ago legals’ wages go up 📈 permalink hellohellohellohell 22 points 5 hours ago If they unleashed a massive H1b, illegal hiring, offshoring crackdown right now, it would basically nullify the petulant "hiring freeze" BlackRock types are trying to perpetrate now. permalink thevagabond 10 points 4 hours ago THIS IS THE WAY, WE HAVE TO PUT PRESSURE ON TRUMP TO DUMP H1B. IT'S GOT TO BE DONE. THERE IS NO OTHER WAY. WE NEED AMERICAN JOBS FOR AMERICANS. permalink whataboob 1 points 5 hours ago Petulant hiring freeze? permalink hellohellohellohell 2 points 4 hours ago https://patriots.win/p/19BtGb0UsQ/bad-job-market-news--the-hiring-/c/ permalink whataboob 8 points 5 hours ago How about the US government who shipped them in here in front of us?! permalink PatriotSkorzeny 5 points 6 hours ago But not the ones that treacherously let him in, or gave him a license? Only the American civilian must be punished in any way for the actions of the “brave men and women”. Got it. permalink whataboob -5 points 5 hours ago This whole site seems like some Democrat plot to drive Americans to fight illegals, as if illegals who were SHIPPED IN HERE BY THE US GOVERNMENT are the enemy… I watched how the US government bussed and flew these people in, and now I’m supposed to be mad at them? Sure, deport, but not getting one ounce of emotion from me over this except maybe sorrow for what our county is doing to these people, using them as pawns in a sick political game. I often feel like I shouldn’t be on this site cuz it’s mostly “dey took err jorbs!!” Mouth breather morons who obsess about illegals all day while forgetting who did this and other vile shit to us. By the way, WHILE THEY IMPORTED MILLION OF POOR PEOPLE ON TOP OF US, they also poisoned millions of Americans with some chemical they kept pretending was medicine (it wasn’t!). Trump still touts OPERATION WARP SPEED as an amazing success. permalink SavingPrivateGrace 52 points 6 hours ago That was fast action. This is the kind of response and timing we need. permalink HunterBidensPC 15 points 6 hours ago Agreed I wanted swift deportation and punishment for those who hired him and I’m happy with the result. permalink Yeti2 10 points 5 hours ago Also jail those that let or brought them in. permalink _Eric_Ciaramella_ 5 points 2 hours ago and the clerks at the dmv who knowingly gave him a license permalink MAGALOVER 4 points 2 hours ago ^^^ THIS right here, Eric !!! I want every one of the fat, lazy, rude DEI hires at the DMV that give illegals driver's licenses FIRED. permalink whataboob -9 points 5 hours ago Ok, another “obsess with illegals at the cost of American rights obsession” bot. The US government shipped these people in, it’s on video in case you forgot who the real enemy is. And now Americans have to lose their businesses and freedom because of this attack on our population by our own government? By the way, I remind again the illegal obsessed mouth breathers on this ever saddening site, that THE US GOVERNMENT ALSO POISONED US WITH SOME CHEMICAL WHILE THEY SHIPPED IN MILLIONS OF ILLEGALS! But this is all in vain. The government did this to us cuz it could cuz look at you people — the government gives you a basic bitch distraction with some Mexicans, and what do you do? You get deeply distracted by some Mexicans, just as they wanted you to be. permalink guywholikesDjtof2024 9 points 5 hours ago that was Biden admin. you are stuck in october 2024. get upgraded. you apparently think trump is biden. permalink Drewniverse 3 points 3 hours ago Wow a whatabob bot imposter. permalink AlaskanCentipede 2 points 3 hours ago Two things can be true If a hitman breaks into my house and murders my wife, I'm mad at both the hitman AND the neighbor who hired him. The hitman doesn't get a pass just because he was "just doing his job" and someone paid for him to be there Of course, the neighbor doesn't get a pass either just because he farmed out a crime to another person Illegals need to go back to whatever shithole country they were flown out of and the government rats who brought them here also need to be punished but the illegals don't get to stay here and keep committing violent crimes just because the feds engineered their arrivals permalink JimmyRussler 3 points 6 hours ago Don't worry I'm sure there's a judge who will be just as quick to overrule it. permalink PatPede1 1 points 8 minutes ago Probably, but the business deserves the hassle until they demonstrate they aren’t hiring absolutely incompetent illegal aliens to fatten their profits. They can now spend their profits on lawyers, watch their insurance become unaffordable and cancelled, get sued into oblivion by the family of the three dead and likely decapitated innocents, and on & on. permalink Madnote1984 3 points 4 hours ago It's one of the best solutions. I predicted/suggested this very thing in a thread yesterday. https://patriots.win/c/TheDonald/p/19BtGYhVFG/ Now they just need to follow through with the rest of my suggestions and they can solve this issue. permalink kishkan 31 points 6 hours ago Not only should the business license be revoked, the company assets should be seized. The family without a doubt should be suing this company into bankruptcy with the government holding the assets. permalink The_Emperor 7 points 4 hours ago The victims may civilly sue, inded. Not the government. permalink Threaper666 2 points 2 hours ago I read the article and it said that California broke its own laws by giving him a license. How the fck does that work? permalink whataboob -4 points 5 hours ago Exactly as the constitution says lol permalink MedicallyReddit 25 points 6 hours ago Poopjeets do NOT belong in America. permalink Klown_Kutz 2 points 21 minutes ago It’s Poojews. permalink whataboob -17 points 5 hours ago You sound retarded. You make deportation seem bad. permalink Afeazo 12 points 5 hours ago Can’t tell if you’re a jeet or jew, not like there’s much difference to be honest. permalink Prandogolio 24 points 6 hours ago I learned on Salty Cracker today the motherfucker couldn't even speak English and failed to answer 10 out of 12 verbal questions correctly for his certification but got a certification anyway permalink mullethawk 1 points 19 minutes ago He's talking about the english language proficiency test they gave him after the crash. You don't actually have to know english to pass the CDL exam and get a commercial driver's license, but I suspect that's about to change. permalink whataboob -19 points 5 hours ago … ? Why is your focus on “the motherfucker” when your whole government, country, and local systems are all involved in doing this? You know the guy was shipped in here by our government, right? Did everyone forget? permalink FatigueIsReal 11 points 5 hours ago His focus is on the motherfucker being given a certification, i.e. the corrupt system. Same as you. No one forgot. permalink _Eric_Ciaramella_ 4 points 2 hours ago hes a leftwing retarded troll permalink Wrexxis780 0 points 3 hours ago I am always surprised when random people think we can't hate on more than one motherfucker at the same time. permalink guywholikesDjtof2024 4 points 5 hours ago is unable to accept that trump won in nov 2024 and still thinks biden is in power permalink Snek_Plissken 1 points 3 hours ago Washington State the liberal hell hole gave him a CDL. California failed to stop him from driving when he transferred his CDL there and couldn’t speak the language. Then the shit fucker company clearly hired an inept street shitter that wasn’t legally allow to drive a truck in the US due to legal status. They certainly didn’t file an i9. permalink ADAM_SCHITT 12 points 6 hours ago Since when does the federal government give out business licenses? It also doesnt mention revoking the license in the article at all, other than the headline. This sounds like another gateway pundit fake news. permalink Robsantosid 18 points 6 hours ago They used the wrong terminology, they revoked the companies “authority” which in effect is a license to haul freight. It’s issued federally. permalink hey_spike 10 points 6 hours ago Transporting goods across state lines seems like something legitimately covered by the interstate commerce clause in the constitution. permalink JerryJerryJerry 4 points 4 hours ago Interstate trucking definitely involves DOT. permalink BidenShowerDrool 4 points 6 hours ago perhaps it's the federally issued Employer Identification Number of the business which gets put on ice and hence the business is now dead in the water. Either way the business has ton of new headaches and law-fare to fight. permalink STRONGLYWORDEDLETTER 1 points 4 hours ago Maybe revoking the EIN? permalink MythArcana 11 points 6 hours ago Inb4 Newsom gives all California residents CDLs. permalink Jackthereaper0015 7 points 5 hours ago I will refrain from celebrating knowing full well these asshats will simply create another operation under a different set of fake names like they have in the past. permalink agave_lime 6 points 4 hours ago The family has other companies in other states. They don't need their license revoked, they need to be imprisoned. permalink Abovethefray 5 points 5 hours ago The Babylon Bee reported today that Newsome personally issued Stevie Wonder a CDL... permalink FreeFire OP 4 points 6 hours ago https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2025/08/trump-administration-revoke-business-license-employer-who-hired/ permalink CLF3 4 points 3 hours ago This will do absolutely nothing. If this company follows the same trends as the others follow they already have a backup MC/USDOT number gaining age and in approximately 30 days they will take their door stickers off the trucks, put new ones on, and continue to operate under a new name as if nothing changed. Aside from extra dot numbers gaining age some companies already operate multiple LLCs just in case. Instead of 150 trucks under one company they spread them out by 20s or 50s. Depending on how much they can tolerate to lose if shit hits the fan. permalink Tunk 2 points 1 hour ago Yeah, an investigation needs to follow the trucks, see which companies have previously owned them. Take all the cancelled/closed companies, and permanently bar any owners/directors, and their family from receiving new permits/licenses and close down existing ones that are marinading. Revoke licenses for drivers that were used by those companies too, and deport any deportables. Seize the trucks while they are at it. Its amazing how often indians get away with shell gaming things like this. Seen it happen in construction, education, and small business (gas stations, restaurants, convenience stores, taxi etc), always several companies on the go. If there are legal problems, shutdown, transfer assets, phoenix under another for a blank slate. Takes decades for regulators to catch up to them, if they ever do. By then they've used their multitude of companies to provide sponsorship to their friends and family, who join in on the matryoshka doll of companies to keep them rolling. They are really good at abusing high trust systems, with low trust values. permalink mullethawk 1 points 15 minutes ago Or they will just illegally buy another immigrant company's DOT number. permalink CrankyCrab 3 points 4 hours ago One down and many more to go, but is there anything that stops these criminals from incorporating a new business??? You know these crooked fuckers know how to cheat the system and there are too many corrupt government workers who will allow it. permalink FatigueIsReal 3 points 5 hours ago Judge saying he can't do this in 3...2..1... permalink MoreVanceMemes 3 points 6 hours ago Jim Hoft is a pedo permalink phro 3 points 5 hours ago Other states should be able to forbid California CDLs too. Just check them all at the border. permalink InfinitesimalOrange 2 points 5 hours ago This is pretty good, I'd prefer whoever hired the man specifically to be punished, but businesses have effectively muddied culpability to such a degree that no specific individual is ever at fault for the machinations of a company unless they need a patsy. permalink FlyCatcher94 2 points 2 hours ago They will just fire up another company. permalink RogueLeaderX 2 points 57 minutes ago He got his work license in California and ends up killing 3 in Florida. That despicable state keeps killing innocents around the country. permalink terribletwos 1 points 5 hours ago Damn. Do it a few more times to make the point clear. permalink AmericanJawa 1 points 5 hours ago This is the way. permalink Bloodclot20 1 points 40 minutes ago Now do all of them permalink hillaryforprison 1 points 3 hours ago Why not ALL businesses who hire them. Why continue the charade? Is the country America first for foreigner first, laws or no laws? permalink AgnesDomini 1 points 4 hours ago MOAR! This is what we voted for, Pedes! permalink crimsontsunami 1 points 28 minutes ago Take PROPERTIES that allow illegals to rent, take businesses that hire anything but 100% pure AMERICAN or LEGAL IMMIGRANTS permalink GainesvilleFlorida 1 points 5 hours ago So yeah this happened here 😠😡😞 permalink asdrubael_was_right 1 points 1 hour ago People need to go to prison for hiring illegals.
