I faced jail time if I refused to pay up, but these fucking commie "representatives" break laws daily and face zero punishment. It's long past time to fuck all these commie traitorous pricks over and ignore all the laws they pass but ignore, but with zero repercussions. permalink One-Man_Riot 6 points 16 hours ago You are almost better off to shooting the cop dead, popping his trunk, taking the video, and driving off. permalink The-Harbinger 11 points 16 hours ago "may face," "could face," "considering charges..." I'm so sick of TGP's rage bait articles. I don't read articles like this anymore, and I'm not going to until the headlines say "arrested for..." or "convicted of..." Wake me up when it says that.

Trump 2.0 has done so many things in such a short amount of time the Democrat Party is completely lost and so is Fake News, Gavin Newscum is legit having a mental breakdown on X every single day. permalink RickFagnolia 3 points 14 hours ago We hear the same bullshit every time a new party is in power.

You see how fucking stupid this all is? permalink LokiHelmsdeep 1 points 1 hour ago No one said that after Biden was "Elected", no one said that after Trump 1.0 won, no one said that after Obama, no one said that after Bush Jr's 2 wins, no one said that after Clinton's 2 wins, no one said that after Bush 1's win.

Mayor Michelle Wu vetoed the attempt, telling the Council that she would not sign off on the budget until "every penny" of the defunding attempt was returned to the Police budget. The City Council tried to override her veto but was unsuccessful. Michelle Wu was singularly responsible for preventing the Boston Police Department from being defunded. She is running for re-election this November. The largest police union for the Boston Police gave her their complete and total endorsement almost immediately after she announced her re-election run. What other mayor of a Blue City has the endorsement of their cities police department??? Oh, and when POTUS removed the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees and put in his own Board, he put in Pam Blondie. Who else did he put in? Dana Blumberg the wife of billionaire Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots and friend of POTUS, whose son Josh Kraft just happens to be running against Michelle Wu for mayor, backed by gobs of money. . Goodness what a coincidence. Wu is crushing him in the polls by 30% BTW and has over a 65% approval rating. And all this pro-Palestine from the river to the sea BS, why don't you hear any of that going on in the City of Boston? The reason is, because as soon as that sprung up in Boston for the first time, at Emerson college, Mayor Wu had the police go in and make multiple arrests. And anyone who put as much as a drop of paint on a statue in Boston was arrested. To quote mayor Wu's letter to Pam Blondie: "local police routinely cooperate with federal law enforcement on criminal matters." When Mayor Wu embarrassed those Republican congress members when she testified before Congress, with her Ash Wednesday ashes and her 6 week old baby on her arm, Mayor Wu cited multiple instances where City of Boston Police cooperated with Federal law enforcement as to criminal illegals. but when it comes to illegals who are working and law abiding and not engaging in criminal activity, it is the job of the Feds, not the Boston city police, to round them up. There is a State of Massachusetts law, not a City of Boston law, not a Mayor Wu law, that says that where someone's only infraction is that they are in the State illegally, where they are not otherwise engaging in criminal activity, that is treated as a criminal violation akin to a speeding ticket. The Feds want The Boston Police to affirmatively go after illegals who are working and not otherwise engaging in criminal activity. Boston Police do not obstruct Federal law enforcement when it comes to Feds efforts at rounding up illegals who are working and not committing crimes. No one in Boston Police or government is "impeding" Federal law enforcement. But the Massachusetts Supreme Court has ruled that the State and City police do not have to affirmatively assist the Feds in their enforcement of federal laws, and they don't. ICE calls its northeast region "Boston" Their region they call "Boston" includes the States of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. That is all called "Boston" to them. Homan disingenuously claims that he "stopped counting at nine" the number of pedophiles who were the subject of ICE detainers who were let go in "Boston." Miller just disingenuously resurrected the case of the Haitian dude who was arrested 17 times and let go by "Boston," that they falsely allege was let go by "Boston" while there was a valid detainer request in place. That they then had to find and rearrest. Ask those two liars (Homan and Miller) of the nine pedophiles after which they stopped counting who were purportedly let go, how many were actually let go by the actual City of Boston. The answer, of course, is zero. Look it up. That Haitian dude who was let go that went viral on Youtube, that Miller resurrected, that dude was released by the City of Worcester Massachusetts. That's an hour west of the City of Boston. Look it up. The story is on Youtube, the Haitian dude was serving 18 months in Worcester Mass. And before they let him out the Worcester police called up ICE and asked ICE if they wanted to pick the dude up and ICE said they weren't going to. So Worcester let him out. This is on Youtube, the Worcester Chief of Police is on video saying this. So ICE effed up andHoman and now Miller are now trying to smear Mayor Wu. The CIty of Boston is not a sanctuary city. The mayor Wu is in favor of robust legal immigration and is against illegal immigration. She testified to Congress that illegal immigration is a criminal violation. But if people who are illegal come to your city and are hungry, what are you going to do? The Federal government under Joe Biden created this illegal immigrant crisis. The federal government under POTUS has the responsibility of fixing it. POTUS just gave Homan 17 billions, fix the problem. To compel Local police forces to affirmatively assist in going after illegals who are working and otherwise committing no crimes, will create big problems with the cops relationships to the communities. Boston is one of the safest big cities in the US. It has their lowest murder rate and the lowest crime rate in 50 years. Feds do your job. Mayor Wu is doing hers. If the dem clowns ever got their act together, (which they won't) they should look to mayor Wu instead of these other Communists and incompetents, for their National stage candidate. But they can't have her for at least the next four years, because she belongs to Boston. And PS: I'm a three time voter for President Trump. Five time counting primaries. I just don't like liars like Homan, and now Miller. permalink TrumpRideorDie74 1 points 16 hours ago "potential" üôÑ permalink BidensfullAFdiaper 1 points 14 hours ago How about fucking predawn raids with televised arrests and peep walks.

I don't think the Trump Admin besides this guy recognizes how desperate the people who voted for him are for better jobs, more jobs, and reducing inflation. The others need to step it up asap. 2025 just has a few more months left. Come 2026, no one will vote for them if they keep allowing in H1Bs and crazy levels of inflation. permalink 45euphorichawk 1 points 16 hours ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink 1281 Stephen Miller Calls Democrat Party an ‚ÄúExtremist Organization‚Äù, Says ‚ÄúEvil‚Äù Sanctuary City Mayors Still Defying ICE Detainers and ‚ÄúNow They Face Potential Criminal Charges for Harboring and Smuggling‚Äù (www.thegatewaypundit.com) posted 17 hours ago by Trick 62 comments IT'S HAPPENING: Stephen Miller Calls Democrat Party an "Extremist Organization", Says "Evil" Sanctuary City Mayors Still Defying...
