We had a basketball coach who would mock the boys and call them gay. He's doing it at another school as the head basketball coach now. permalink HurtzLocker 41 points 17 hours ago In this house we say "gay" and "retarded." permalink FrmrAmericanRepublic 13 points 14 hours ago "Faggot" is more proper.

When I was a military brat in the 80s my family lived in Mississippi for a bit and they were distributing copies of the New Testament in public schools.

The principal told me to take it down, despite being the GSA advisor and having a flag like this on my desk for the last ten years. At the end of last year, all of the Safe Space stickers I worked so hard to get teachers around the school to adopt came down and now this.

I always wondered how or why. I know that the damn paper the teacher is reading off of said my name, the shorter version of the longer name. Its even what is on my birth certificate!

Compliance enforcement is where things will get interesting. permalink TheThreeSeashells 17 points 18 hours ago This is where parents need to step up to instruct their kids to enforce compliance. Not necessarily doing it themselves, but teaching their kids to report this stuff back to the parents. "Hey mom and dad! I was looking for the ten commandments today like you told me to do every day and the teacher hid it behind a coat rack again." Parents can't rely on government to pass laws doing their job for them.

Needs to be left to the families or everyone will overburden their religion as well and claim its only fair, then years later they will remove the Christian ideals and completely replace with their own.

For equal protection to mean anything it must go both ways, and hiding behind "we don't invoke a god" is bs. Neither does Zen, Confucianism, Daoism, Satanism, etc. A better tack would be to take the 600 or so levitical laws and rephrase and edit them, where possible, to remove any reference to God or overtly religious practices. You could easily get a hundred "secular" and nontheistic rules that would drive them absolutely crazy, and kids will wonder if they might be stoned for being idle and rebellious. permalink GabeC1997 1 points 16 hours ago Honestly, just kill off the whole institution.
