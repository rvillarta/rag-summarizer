1694 The woke CEO of Target just RESIGNED. posted 16 hours ago by I-am-Orlando PRO 224 comments 224 comments LBTrumplican2 124 points 16 hours ago To be replaced by another woke CEO? permalink invalid_data 66 points 15 hours ago Exactly, CEOs are just the puppets of their masters the banks and the board.

AllHailKingDonald 7 points 14 hours ago Booo! permalink ItsFunToSay-M-A-G-A 2 points 11 hours ago Best late night interview derailment ever!! 🤣 permalink they-see-me-trollin PRO 4 points 10 hours ago a lot of people don't realize what a scam quantitative easing was. in quantitative easing, the fed issues new money to businesses in exchange for corporate bonds. the problem is they don't just issue that money to any corporations, not even by some ranking system or the S&P500, Dow, etc. no, they issue it to their political allies hedge funds. then those hedge funds go and buy up shitloads of stock and board seats and real estate. sometimes it goes under the guise of "private equity". when you trace it back to the humans responsible for those hedge funds, the biggest recipient was Larry Fink, CEO of blackrock, and literal communist. the second largest was William McNabb III, the former CEO of vanguard, also renowned for his radical leftist views. that's why starting in 2009, corporate america started shifting far left, increasingly taking up radical and extreme positions. that's because they'd buy up board seats and then use the board to push leftist extremism. it's why corporate america was suddenly pushing everything from racial hate speech to communist vaccine mandates. since 2009, we're talking trillions of dollars of inflation, more than quadrupling the US money supply, and basically handing all that value and power to communist inner party extremists. but wait, there's more! if the hedge fund went under because the stocks and board seats they bought up began to fail, they'd just walk away and dissolve the hedge fund. the fed writes the bond off as a total loss. it's such a fucking scam. permalink tpactionchasethevote 1 points 7 hours ago absolutely insane. occupy wallstreet seems to be the point at which identity politics took over. that was in 2011. you are saying it started earlier in 2009. permalink they-see-me-trollin PRO 1 points 17 minutes ago they used the financial crash as the guise to justify it. in the first year, it wasn't that much, only like a trillion dollars. and QE hadn't been done before, so it wasn't super noticeable. businesses also took some time to take the bait. eventually it got out that if you didn't take the money, your competitor would. and since they had infinite money available, they could just ping pong a buyer's auction. the tipping point was probably 2012 or so, when enough had taken such large amounts of money that if you didn't take it also, you were going to get drowned out by the shitty economic conditions. as Fink gathered more and more power, he started to roll out more aggressive and extremist policy through those board seats. that's why in corporate america, they wouldn't shut the fuck up about LGBT or race. permalink DT170x 33 points 15 hours ago I bet 200 dollars is going to be an Indian CEO. permalink cciv 11 points 15 hours ago Nah, it's their current COO who has been with the company for decades. permalink tpactionchasethevote 1 points 7 hours ago do you think anything will change? what does target need to do in theory? permalink bangbus 8 points 13 hours ago HQ is in Minneapolis, it better be a Somalian or I will protest. permalink LaVaughnRobinson 8 points 15 hours ago Retain don't do Indians, its always white dudes. permalink doodaddy 3 points 13 hours ago Microsoft?

Walmart was all gay pride too Biden years. Those boards of directors are whores. permalink AmericanLaborLover 1 points 15 hours ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink mygovisacommie 36 points 15 hours ago Never turn your back on your conservative customers. There are more of us than there are liberals because we work. When you realize what you’ve done it’s already too late and there is no going back for two reasons. 1) we don’t forgive you 2) the liberals won’t forgive you for trying to backtrack. What this means is that once you’ve made the decision to alienate the conservatives, you either exclusively sell to broke liberals who don’t buy your shit, or you are doomed to capsize when you try to right the ship. Just don’t do it. The only winning move is not to play. permalink KekistanPM 12 points 14 hours ago I'm not going to my nearest Target ever again. They locked up the things I used to go there for behind a glass case. It's located near a bad neighborhood but I'm not shopping anywhere that treats me like a shoplifter or potential shoplifter. permalink HelluvaEngineer 16 points 14 hours ago Years ago I was shopping at a Publix in a bad area. They had a cop on duty. I had to go to the bathroom. When I came back out the cop stopped me and asked to see everything in my pockets. I told him I wouldn't do that because I have a gun in my pocket. He asked if he could see it! I was like "No I don't want to die." Then he was like "go to my car with me and show me" and I was like "No I don't want to die." He babbled on for 5 minutes and I showed him my CCL license and finally I asked if I was being detained or if I was free to leave. I never went back to that store. They somehow profiled the ONE white guy who was there to be a shoplifter. permalink DaninElkhart 8 points 12 hours ago If they try to catch actual shoplifters they might be called, "RAaaay-ccissts!! permalink covok48 5 points 9 hours ago Sounds like the TSA. permalink tpactionchasethevote 1 points 7 hours ago I am sorry that happened to you. permalink TheThreeSeashells 5 points 14 hours ago There was a scene in an under-the-radar movie called Running Scared (with Paul Walker, not the Billy Crystal movie) where a child has to be rescued from a pedophile's/murderer's home. Every Target I've ever been in reminds me of that home. That said, I haven't stepped foot in a Target in about 15 years. permalink Maskurbator 1 points 4 hours ago Criminally underrated movie. permalink covok48 2 points 9 hours ago They treat you like a jogger? permalink Maskurbator 1 points 4 hours ago They have to do that so long as blacks are allowed in.

Too many on our side have short memories. I bet there are plenty of people on our side still buying Gillette razors, watching the NFL, and drinking Bud Light, just to name a few. In this war, forgetting and caving is forgiving. permalink SPEDMan64 3 points 13 hours ago I don't do any of those. I haven't even stopped at a BP station since the Gulf oil spill. If I say I am done with something, I am done with it. Ask my brother when we last spoke (and tell me because it's been so long I can't quite remember). permalink TheThreeSeashells 4 points 13 hours ago Looks like we're probably in the minority. I also won't buy any Hershey products because they fired a bunch of people who refused to get the clot shot. The list goes on and on. permalink SPEDMan64 2 points 5 hours ago I think their chocolate is lame plus I have the 45rpm single by Millions of Dead Cops with their hit single, "Radioactive Chocolate" about the Three Mile Island event and the proximity to the Hershey plant. permalink view 1 more comments... covok48 2 points 9 hours ago True, but for some reason there are no good alternatives for a lot of these products. permalink TheThreeSeashells 1 points 5 hours ago For the three I mentioned, I don't watch pro football anymore, I don't drink alcohol, and I use an electric shaver, so it's pretty easy. It is tough with some others. Coca-Cola, for example has their tentacles in a lot of products. I mentioned Hershey's to another guy and they seem to have taken over a lot of candies, too. Luckily in regard to both, I don't drink soft drinks (all I drink is water) and don't eat a lot of candy. One of the easiest is cutting out streaming services that constantly produce and push Leftist garbage. I subscribe to none of them. I don't pirate stuff either. If I can't get it legitimately and legally for free, I don't get to watch it. I read a lot, do a lot of crosswords/word puzzles, and listen to music (actual music, not the crap they're trying to pass off today as "music") and I'm satisfied. permalink BamPondi 2 points 13 hours ago "Brian Cornell to be replaced next year as retailer navigates boycott over its scaling back of DEI initiatives" https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/20/target-ceo-steps-down permalink YodaBannon 17 points 16 hours ago later dumbass permalink icreatedthisforthis 25 points 16 hours ago I'm so glad he had to give back all that money he earned after making such a stupid decision to push DEI, right?

How? By making Target stores 24x7 like Walmart used to be, but flipping them to a controlled access, members-only model after 9PM. Have to pay a nominal amount for membership, only available to 21+, no kids allowed after normal hours, and if you cause any kind of problems at all during membership hours you're banned from the store. They be poaching from Costco, Sams, Walmart, people would come from miles around to be able to get their shopping done late at night again. AND without having to deal with shitbirds? They'd be printing money. permalink TheThreeSeashells 7 points 14 hours ago Conservative ideas: Here's how you can be successful AND make the majority of your potential customers happy. Leftist ideas: Let's cater to perverts despite alienating and repelling a vast percentage of the population. Coincidentally, the same percentage of the population that actually works for a living and has a predominantly lower crime rate. permalink yummy_yumm_yumms 7 points 15 hours ago I love this idea. I'd rather go at midnight and check myself out. It really pisses me off all the stores never extended their hours to what they were pre-CHINA-virus. permalink DestroyerofCobwebs 10 points 15 hours ago It's 100% because of theft. I know the GM of a couple of my local grocery stores. One of them really tried to keep their midnight hours (everyone else closes at 10), but there's a domino effect to it. He told me it had gotten so bad they were losing in some cases $1000+ a night to retail theft. They tried all kinds of things to slow it down, but nothing worked. I really think Target should do this. They could keep staffing minimal, automate most everything; as long as you've got a trust relationship with the people going in during those hours, it wouldn't be a big deal. Probably not necessary to do it at every Target location in a big city, but even one or two would make a huge difference in a lot of people's lives. permalink yummy_yumm_yumms 3 points 13 hours ago Damn that's wild! I do really like the Target idea and I would sign up for it at one of the local grocery stores in my town, but I think it would at least need an armed security guard to make sure people aren't waiting by the door and scooting in behind actual members. permalink 5DchessWatch 6 points 14 hours ago Dude that's a GREAT idea Call it Target MIDNIGHT membership, and its an obsidian BLACK card like the amex black permalink RustySheckelford 2 points 9 hours ago Target after Dark sounds dope af permalink Chickapede 11 points 15 hours ago I stopped shopping there when they made the bathrooms a troon sauna. permalink Tongs_Ya_Bass 9 points 16 hours ago Missed, the target. Faggot. permalink IncredibleMrE1 9 points 16 hours ago He'll be replaced by someone even worse. permalink ckover9000 8 points 15 hours ago Plummeting sales. Proud to have done my part. Between groceries and plastic shit probably spent over $800/mo there until 2020. Haven't spent a dime since. Not to mention over the years since just about everyone sends target gift cards for bdays, etc and haven't used a single one, they can't report the revenue from gift cards until it's spent so technically it's a loss. If someone based becomes CEO I'll use them but not shopping there again outside of that just out of spite. permalink Aquamine-Amarine 2 points 15 hours ago How did you spend $800 a month there? I'm going to assume most of that was the plastic shit you mentioned. It's a horrible place to buy groceries since they're expensive. You'll save more money going to Aldi. permalink ckover9000 1 points 12 hours ago Family of 4. Groceries were a little pricier but the place was nicer than all the ghetto stores in the area and location was convenient to my former commute. A bike here, a TV there, other household stuff you would grab on the way as needed plus they are good with placement of the impulse buys LOL. Didn't really shop many other places. That was when you could get everything needed plus groceries for $800/mo.

Either the CEOs enact queerness and DEI, or they will be hurt on BlackRock's Aladdin business "intelligence" system that determines who gets institutional money. Here's a short video of the king goblin, Larry Fink, admitting it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwwN5kwjAtQ If you don't know about this, you're not paying attention and spending too much time on FoxNews. Don't believe me? Go to Yahoo Finance, or any stock market site, and look to see who the holders are of company stocks. It's always BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard. The CEOs must do what they're told or they will have institutional funds withheld. See for yourself: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TGT/holders/ I knew a guy who worked at a place for 30 years and didn't have the brains to look-up who really owned the company. permalink roadrunner0 4 points 14 hours ago How many fags and queers do these idiots actually think there are?? Pandering to maybe 1% of the population while excluding 80% who believe they are mentally ill is damn stupid from a business prospective.. This goes to show that it was all a coordinated effort to destroy US society and culture just like the mass influx of illegals.. permalink glasscrawler 3 points 14 hours ago But there's the 40% who believe a business is evil and discriminatory if they don't celebrate every insane thought that pops out of academia. permalink roadrunner0 3 points 14 hours ago That is what they want you to think because of the vocal minority making it seem to be a large number when it actually is far less than 15% and many of those don't have money to spend anyway.. permalink glasscrawler 3 points 13 hours ago I don't know.

Our business has been flat for a year now. They're citing tariffs as the reason. I think that part is bullshit, but I'm a developer responsible for our financial system so I know the numbers are legit flat, both month over month and year over year. I'm hoping to hell things turn around in the next couple of months and we get back to growing. I'm sick and fucking tired of having the rug pulled out from under me. I lost my last job of 10 years in March 2020 due to idiotic COVID policies, and I had planned on finishing my career there. I lost my job before that because it was a startup that got purchased by a giant corporation after the 08 crash, and I was given the choice of moving to Atlanta or taking a severance. Given Atlanta's demographics, I took the severance. So I really need the economic good news to finally be tangibly felt by both businesses and individuals. I'm sick and tired of the government fucking up my life permalink tpactionchasethevote 1 points 7 hours ago Great insight.

Then it was trans kids, and adult "tuckable" swimwear Target has faced backlash related to its LGBTQ+ merchandise, including items perceived as supporting transgender rights, leading the company to remove certain products from its stores and website in 2023. Among the controversial items were swimsuits described as "tuck friendly," marketed toward trans women, and merchandise from the brand Abprallen, which features occult-themed designs. While Target did not specify all items being removed, it cited threats to employee safety as the reason for pulling some LGBTQ+ merchandise. permalink Hawksendoom 1 points 12 hours ago Look at that ever loving punchable fucking face. permalink FiresideRant 1 points 13 hours ago "just resigned"... and will live like a king for the rest of his life. permalink NonbinaryPotatohead 1 points 8 hours ago The models plastered on the walls in the female clothing section speaks....VOLUMES....dun dun tsssst permalink zippy2 1 points 3 hours ago I just realized I never stepped foot in there since the tranny bathing suit that they denied carrying but people took pictures of. permalink bringbackthe80s 1 points 13 hours ago They'll just plug another DEI candidate right in. permalink Meddlesom 1 points 14 hours ago Wait, you mean that pandering to degenerate fringe groups of faggots, trannies, and pedophiles, and pissing off the overwhelming majority of normal people isn't profitable? permalink BamPondi 1 points 13 hours ago but Target has been boycotted this year because they stopped doing DEI - so um... what? this post is bullshit permalink Meddlesom 1 points 12 hours ago Yeah, after all the normal people stopped going, they didn't return just because Target stopped DEI hiring. They're still stocking the shelves with faggotry and child grooming. They stopped the DEI hiring, and so the orcs and beaners boycotted them too. Target made their bed, shat in it, and now they get to sleep in it. permalink freebirdie 1 points 13 hours ago There's nothing target can do to get me to shop there again.

Now I shop there maybe 1 time every 3 months and only for a product I cant find anywhere else. I will buy that 1 item and that's it. Not even an extra bottle of water. permalink Hikedelics 1 points 15 hours ago Didn’t target already walk back from LGBTBBQ stuff a couple years ago? I want to say they were one of the first ones to back track from it and they caught a lot of backlash from the leftists. Their sales skyrocketed afterwards, but don’t let that fool you, the commies were big mad 😆 permalink ShadowInv 1 points 15 hours ago It might be the economy and a lack of product selection. permalink Donold 1 points 15 hours ago jewish Indian black fat slut enters the chat. permalink Beeboy 1 points 11 hours ago I stopped shopping at Target years ago permalink TheImpossible1 0 points 15 hours ago Can't wait for the tradcuck section.
