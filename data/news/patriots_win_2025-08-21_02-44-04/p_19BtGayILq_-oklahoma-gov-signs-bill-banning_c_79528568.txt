So one safe place to send your child is priceless permalink deleted 6 points 17 hours ago Spindle-spin 4 points 17 hours ago This needs to be higher. He's clearly just kissing Trump's ass and waiting until President Vance permalink War_Hamster 5 points 17 hours ago The problem is the schools are riddled with true believers who will just keep teaching DEI stuff under another name. permalink Icepck 3 points 17 hours ago Here in Oklahoma all the liberal moms complain that we are ranked near last in education for the past few years. permalink mojorisen 3 points 15 hours ago The Tulsa and OK City Schools are pretty bad. The suburban schools are really good. permalink BlackPilledMAGA 12 points 18 hours ago DEI is racism and should be banned everywhere. Didn't Earn It. permalink user2827 5 points 17 hours ago They'll just rename it, would need to ban the actions... and even then some will just do it without talking about it. permalink RINO_fatigue 10 points 18 hours ago Those institutions are already staffed almost entirely by DEI hires, cutting funding for further faggotry is fine, but it won't solve the whole problem since the barn door was left wide open for the past several decades and the fox now lives comfortably in the hen house. permalink War_Hamster 4 points 17 hours ago Yup, the only way to get the schools to stop is to change the financial incentives. Getting the gov't out of student lending would go a long ways. If private lenders are writing the checks, you're going to see lower overall costs, much fewer degrees in DEI subjects, and the colleges will have to trim their staff. permalink Lol_Garrus 8 points 18 hours ago So following civil rights act of 1965? permalink War_Hamster 2 points 17 hours ago You didn't read the fine print where it says there's an exception that lets them discriminate against white people. permalink MAGAguitar 7 points 18 hours ago Every ban deserves to be celebrated permalink greatpumpkin 5 points 18 hours ago .... now if he'd only do something about that asinine state income tax .... permalink MythArcana OP 4 points 18 hours ago Archive Link : https://archive.ph/la0Kx Direct Link : https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/08/20/oklahoma-gov-signs-bill-banning-funding-for-dei-in-higher-education/ Pepe Link : 🐸👌 permalink Choppermagic 4 points 17 hours ago All these weak ass politicians needed Trump to lead the way permalink LostSailor 4 points 17 hours ago Half the employees at TPS just lost their job. Couldn't happen to a better group of union workers. permalink Oodles 3 points 16 hours ago They need to follow up and audit the schools. I know in Iowa several university employees were caught on hidden camera admitting they were still funding now illegal DEI programs by changing the names permalink PillarOfWisdom 3 points 15 hours ago Don't get too excited. The governor recently signed a bill giving mandatory tests of marxist teachers is being conducted by Prager U . https://kfor.com/news/local/osdes-partnership-with-prageru-under-investigation/ permalink Bidensmellslikepiss 3 points 15 hours ago Twenty years from now, I hope our schools are teaching kids about the democrats' blatant racism, child killing, and election stealing and the dangers of crybullies. permalink knnbccb 3 points 15 hours ago You need to take out the 'activist investors' who aggressively push DEI and ESG, sometimes in the form of 'philanthropy'. Their 'charity' comes with strings attached. permalink roadrunner0 3 points 14 hours ago DEI has always been a cover for Communism and grooming.. permalink LogicCircuits 3 points 17 hours ago “But Oklahoma is worst in the nation in education!!!” permalink MasterVader2U 2 points 17 hours ago They just rename it. permalink SuperHonkey 2 points 10 hours ago Based OK 👌🏻 permalink Frfrfrfrfr -1 points 8 hours ago Is the DEI in the room with us right now? permalink spentcoffee -7 points 18 hours ago they have colleges in oklahoma? permalink Krat 4 points 18 hours ago Nobody has colleges anymore. Academia has like a student body that is 40-50% foreign. They are basically using academics to train anti-americanism across the globe. We are training our invaders and paying for it willingly but nobody has colleges with the intent to train people and educate them. That is NOT the goal of "colleges" anymore. permalink 1394 🏫 Oklahoma Gov. Signs Bill Banning Funding for DEI in Higher Education 🚫 DIDN'T EARN IT posted 18 hours ago by MythArcana 28 comments
