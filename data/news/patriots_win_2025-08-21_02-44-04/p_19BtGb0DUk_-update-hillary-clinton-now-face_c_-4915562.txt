The last time she practiced law she was getting kicked off the Watergate Investigation for her lack of ethics. permalink 5DchessWatch 6 points 10 hours ago Jerry Zeifman, who was the general counsel and chief of staff to the House Judiciary Committee during the Watergate investigation, accused Hillary Clinton (then Hillary Rodham) of confiscating public documents because he claimed she removed files related to the Douglas case to her secured office, making them inaccessible to the public. According to Zeifman, this action was part of an effort to support a fraudulent legal brief arguing that President Nixon had no right to legal counsel during impeachment proceedings, despite precedent established in the Douglas case. He alleged that her actions were intended to undermine Nixon‚Äôs defense and obstruct the investigation. Zeifman reportedly fired her for these reasons and later expressed regret for not reporting her to bar associations. However, these claims have not been independently confirmed. source BRAVE AI permalink Prandogolio 20 points 13 hours ago üö® OH SHIT UPDATE!!

Just sayin' permalink KekistanPM 6 points 12 hours ago If I were in that government watchdog group, I'd make sure my personal affairs were in order. permalink RentedMule 4 points 12 hours ago You could be right. I'd love to see her behind bars, or better yet, on the gallows. But a punishment of a death by a thousand cuts would be satisfying to see as well. Let's just hope this is the first of many cuts. permalink goodtimebox 13 points 13 hours ago I've read and seen a lot of videos about Hillary and know one thing for certain.

That way we have Bill‚Äôs legacy stain from the blue dress stain, matched with Hilldawg‚Äôs legacy violation from her Constitutional violation. Better than we were with Barr‚Äôs Durham Dance and the old Whitewater Whitewash. Give Obama the same legacy enema. Then prosecute Brennan, Comey, Clapper, Yates, Orr couple, McCabe, Naker, Haspell, etc. Watergate saw 48 pleas & guilty verdicts.
