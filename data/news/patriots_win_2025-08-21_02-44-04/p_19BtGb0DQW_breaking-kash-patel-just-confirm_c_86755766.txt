And THEY should be arrested! 41 comments USDMaga 26 points 13 hours ago WOW If only he knew someone in the FBI that could arrest them for crimes. Anyone know the email of the FBI director so I can send it to him? permalink daty_dato 11 points 12 hours ago FBI refers it to the DOJ. permalink DrWeeGee 16 points 12 hours ago Pam Bondi is the biggest fucking failure. What a cunt, there I said it. I'm tired of pussy footing. The woman doesn't do shit other than spend time putting on make up and talking on TV. Total fucking disgrace. Trump needs to fire her ass, she is beyond incompetent. Thank you for your attention to this matter. permalink spezisacuckold 2 points 9 hours ago It's well past fucking time she arrested even a single person. Even if she at some point somehow pulls off the biggest arrest-spree of all time and that's the reason for nothing so far, then it's still a total fucking failure because of how stupid past late it would be. permalink daty_dato 0 points 7 hours ago Maybe he'll get to that point, wish she'd just stay off TV. Everyone is in a huge hurry to get everything done. It hasn't been that long, some of this stuff takes time. Some of your hostility might be guys like Barnes ceaseless whining about her inaction on his pet projects. permalink Wexit-Delecto 2 points 11 hours ago Maybe he could at least fire them? Or no, is that too rude? permalink DahnaldTrump 13 points 13 hours ago Wow thanks for mentioning some other major crime that everyone was already aware of. Can‚Äôt wait to see you do nothing at all about it. permalink fuck__cnn 6 points 12 hours ago And our Humiliation Ritual continues... permalink DuesImperator 8 points 12 hours ago Soooooooo what will happen to the people that approved it and those that actually did it?!? permalink starjello 8 points 12 hours ago They have already been handsomely rewarded and are now enjoying the spoils of war. permalink America_No_1 6 points 12 hours ago My big problem is yes, people are getting dismissed and fired from all of the intelligence agencies and USAID. But why are there no criminal prosecutions for stealing billions in tax dollars? permalink keeptherepublic1776 6 points 12 hours ago So how about stop fucking talking and arrest everyone. Shut down businesses.we need a dictator for 90 days to fix this shit permalink B-2StealthTrump 5 points 13 hours ago No shit, pajeet. WTF are you gonna do about it? permalink rivetjoint2 4 points 12 hours ago MOAR!!! permalink ReleasetheList 4 points 12 hours ago Unless arrests are actually made in all these crimes we already knew about for years, I'll have to assume this is a demoralization campaign to keep telling us about corrupt bastards they have the evidence to arrest but don't. permalink Stanwyk74 4 points 12 hours ago So hangings permalink starjello 3 points 12 hours ago Uhhhh no.

Just like Ruby Things could have gone so badly for the FBI. permalink perma-maga 1 points 13 hours ago how did they get the warrant? permalink DJT4MoreYears 1 points 11 hours ago U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart signed off on the search warrant for the FBI raid of former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate on August 8, 2022. Reinhart, who has served as a federal magistrate judge in Florida since 2018, previously worked as a federal prosecutor before entering private practice, where he represented employees of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. He also made political donations to both Barack Obama‚Äôs 2008 presidential campaign and Jeb Bush‚Äôs 2016 campaign. permalink perma-maga 1 points 11 hours ago where's the affidavit and who signed it? permalink rivetjoint2 1 points 12 hours ago I think is was a DC judge. permalink perma-maga 1 points 12 hours ago there has to be an affidavit permalink rivetjoint2 1 points 12 hours ago Still need a judge to swallow (in the case of the DC bench willingly swallow) the BS and grant the warrant. permalink imnotdeadyet 1 points 12 hours ago A judge, but is they made shit up, the judge may or may not be in on the crime. permalink starjello 2 points 12 hours ago I'll go with may for a 1000 Alex. permalink YodaBannon 1 points 6 hours ago it was for the optics.
