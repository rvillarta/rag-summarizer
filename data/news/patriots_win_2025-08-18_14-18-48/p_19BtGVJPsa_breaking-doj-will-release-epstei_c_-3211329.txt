permalinkWtf_socialismreally 3 points1 hour agoMoving the whole field there at this point.
permalinkKlaus73 3 points59 minutes agoActually in Trumps own words the "Epstien files" were a hoax.
permalinkNeo2025 2 points46 minutes ago....The down votes are probably coming because your reply to the proceeding comment made it seem as though you though his sentiment was serious....
....And what people need to make a point about, is that while Epstein might have been used by US intelligence (in addition to being used by Israeli intelligence) that's a situation we can no longer rectify.
However, we should damn well make sure our intelligence agencies don't abuse children for intelligence gains ANYMORE.
And that is why there needs to be some answers regarding Epstein.
permalinkMkultraUSA 1 points59 minutes agothank you
permalinkjapplekun 6 points2 hours agoDon't exist? More like rewritten and rigged by the Biden admin so they could piggybank on the push for it.

permalinkSea_Still 53 points2 hours agoAnything they release now will be fabricated horseshit
permalinkFatigueIsReal 17 points2 hours agoAnything they released on Day 1 of Trump's presidency could have been fabricated horseshit.
Anything they released the day he was arrested could have been fabricated horseshit.
Everyone has their own timeline for when they think they're being lied to.
The important thing to realize is that you were never going to see the unaltered evidence.
permalinkmonkadelic 2 points5 minutes agoNo way, we decided as a group that media reporting on this one specific topic was spot on, and therefore a physical list exists, and has all your hopes and dreams on it.
permalinkRationalThought 13 points2 hours agoBiBi flight coming to DC in 3...2...
permalinkBrez 3 points37 minutes agoDon't be surprised if it's not much of anything. The sum total of these gathered facts led to only the 2 people you know of charged in like 2 decades of this being in the public radar. Either the facts aren't there, or they just didn't look for the facts. The last thing I'd expect is some very detailed proof of anything. The most substantial thing to expect might be victim interviews and statements with some crazy shit, and some kind of "justification" to why the investigation didn't go further based on these statements.
permalinkImClearlyLost 2 points20 minutes agoI agree with you but that‚Äôs the reason I want to see this stuff. We should be able to scrutinize the investigation, or the lack of investigation.
permalinkbumpman 2 points18 minutes agoNo shit Sherlock..
You think they‚Äôre gonna go through the trouble of killing Epstein but leave a client list??
Some of y‚Äôall don‚Äôt understand how cover ups work

permalinkIlhansBrother 11 points1 hour agoIs there anything trump won‚Äôt do for Israel?
(because they will still vote for Zoran Mandani over Trump)
permalink37dwarves 3 points45 minutes agoHe owes them for letting him win.
permalinkbumpman 2 points15 minutes agoVegas let‚Äôs hardcore violent criminals go everyday on bail, but somehow trump did this?
This is a blue city problem not a conspiracy
permalinkFatigueIsReal -4 points2 hours agoThese comments are my favorite. They're all over reddit anytime anything at all happens.
Its always a distraction for whatever thing the commenter just became aware of.
permalinkmonkadelic 1 points2 minutes agowell at least in this thread there isn't 17 people going "cool, now what about epstien".  As though we aren't capable of more than one issue.

permalinkIlhansBrother 2 points1 hour agoDOJ will begin to release Epstein records.
You get Pam‚Äôs binder today.
Everything else - you get in 2 more weeks ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
permalinkTookens 18 points2 hours agoYou can bet your life that they won't be releasing the good stuff.
permalinkmyke 3 points1 hour ago...describe, in vague terms, what you mean by 'the good stuff.'
permalinkTookens 7 points1 hour agoIdentifying records, grand jury testimony, classified information..
permalinkbumpman 2 points10 minutes agoYour theory is:
The deepstate or whoever is skilled and powerful enough to kill Epstein and frame it as suicide, but they‚Äôre dumb enough to leave the ‚Äúgood stuff‚Äù in a file and hand it over to Trump administration?
That would be a weird way of doing a coverup.
permalinkTookens 1 points39 seconds agoI literally never said that.  Epstein killed himself.
permalinkOhioRepublic 17 points2 hours ago"We're still talking about that guy?"
permalinkJalapeno_gringo 12 points2 hours agoLet me guess... In 2 weeks

permalinkTrumpsWall 9 points2 hours agoIs it going to be one of those blackout documents?
permalinkmyke 4 points1 hour ago27 all-black pages and a laughing emoji. Interesting...
permalinkKlaus73 2 points55 minutes agoOr it will be the lunch orders of the folk on the oversight comitee.
Again I hate to say it but I think the whole "the deep state" thing has gone to becoming a meme.
Basically if its good its Trump; if its bad its clearly the deep state - essentially offering a divine excuse for any bad outcome.
this reminds me of the unedited Epstien video...
permalinkKlown_Kutz 5 points1 hour agoWhat files?  Fox News Host oops I mean AG Pam Bondi said there weren't any.

permalinkingrowntoenail 4 points2 hours agoWhy wait until Friday?  Tick Tock...
permalinkTheRedPilledArtist 4 points2 hours agoBecause then they can run out the clock Friday, do the bare minimum, do nothing all weekend, and move on by Monday as everyone's already talking about something else by then.
permalinkmyke 3 points1 hour agoThat's plan A. Four and a half, roughly, days between then and now - plenty of opportunity for life to happen.
permalinkTheRedPilledArtist 4 points2 hours agoWhich desk on Capitol Hill?

permalinkSgtThoughtCrime2020 3 points2 hours agoDid United States of America get renamed Capitol Hill recently?
permalinkKernalMustard 2 points25 minutes agoIf this is true. I'm done. This is the one thing I ever wanted from Trump. To defeat the DS and drain the Swamp. If there isnt evidence you can use tell us. Tell us so we can move the fuck on.
permalinkutfanx2 2 points1 hour agoWhat percentage of the Oversight Committee are in the files?

permalinkMAGA_NRG 1 points1 hour agoSpread out over 3 1/2 years
permalinknoPTSDforMePlease 1 points1 hour agoIt's pretty impressive how, by saying he wouldn't release these files, he got the entirety of the Democrats to call for  their release. Now they can't ignore them if they implicate Democrats.
I think trump is mentioned in the files, but my guess is that he never did anything criminal nor disgusting.
The fall out is going to be pretty wide reaching. My guess is several famous celebrities and rich civilians, and minor politicians will end up being charged. I don't think the clintons or other high ranking politicians will be charged.
We will see.
